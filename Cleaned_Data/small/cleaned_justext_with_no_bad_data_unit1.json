In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.” Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.” Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post. “By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.” Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information. Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie. Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica eitherÂ played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential electionÂ or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to helpÂ disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails. In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign). …We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trumpâs campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didnât have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (itâs probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as Iâve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly thereâs psychographic data thatâs baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because weâre not reinventing the wheel. [Weâve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and weâve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didnât have time. We just couldnât do that. The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015. The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform. Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena. “Thereâs no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which weâre taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.” TechCrunch has reached out to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica with additional questions about the timing of this disclosure and the data’s relationship, if any, to the Trump campaign and will update when we hear back."}

Facebook does provide a way for their users to obtain a copy of all the information the social networking has on someone since they joined the site, including what it knows about their interests, ‘likes’ as well as their photos, messages posts, comments, contact information and even data acquired by the Facebook app that can potentially include contact numbers, call logs and contact names. It can be quite shocking to learn just how much information the world’s largest social networking knows about you. Many Facebook users have been surprised to discover that the Facebook app had been rummaging through their phone contacts, obtaining numbers and names as well as call logs (you can stop the apps from doing that by following our instructions here) and others were surprised to see that Facebook knew the adverts they had clicked on, topics they have liked and old events they had frequented.

(Hendrik Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images) With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve. THE BIG IDEA: PALO ALTO, Calif. â When historian Niall Ferguson moved from Harvard to Stanford two years ago, he was struck by Silicon Valleyâs indifference to history. The hubris he saw reminded him of what he encountered on Wall Street as he researched a book about the history of banking during the years before the financial crisis. He became convinced the technology sector was careening toward its own crisis and decided to write about it. The crisis has finally arrived, thanks to Cambridge Analytica, conveniently timed to coincide with the publication of Fergusonâs new book on the history of social networks, from the Freemasons to Facebook. âThe Square and the Towerâ is a cautionary tale that challenges the conventional wisdom that growing interconnectedness is inherently good for society. âOur networked world is fundamentally vulnerable, and two-factor authentication wonât save us,â Ferguson said at the Hoover Institution, where he is a senior fellow. Since President Trumpâs victory, much has been written about parallels between the present and the rise of authoritarian leaders in the 1930s. Ferguson thinks thatâs lazy analysis. For most of the 20th century, communications systems were amenable to central control. This was a fluke of the Industrial Revolution, which produced telegraphs and then telephones. These technologies had an architecture that allowed whoever controlled the hub to dominate the spokes, which led to more hierarchical power structures. To understand the current era, Ferguson believes we need to look more at what happened after Johannes Gutenberg developed the printing press. Like the Web, the use of these presses was difficult to centrally control. âAt the beginning of the Reformation 501 years ago, Martin Luther thought naively that if everybody could read the Bible in the vernacular, theyâd have a direct relationship with God, it would create âthe priesthood of all believersâ and everything would be awesome,â Ferguson said. âWeâve said the same things about the Internet,â he added. âWe think that's obviously a good idea. Except it's not obviously a good idea, any more than it was in the 16th century. Because what the Europeans had was not âthe priesthood of all believers.â They had 130 years of escalating religious conflict, culminating in the Thirty Years War â one of the most destructive conflicts ever.â The more he studies that period, the more echoes Ferguson sees in the 21st century. âWhat one can see in the 16th and 17th centuries is polarization, fake news-type stories, the world getting smaller and therefore contagion is capable of spreading much faster,â Ferguson said. âThese big shifts in network structure led to revolutions against hierarchical institutions.â Ferguson points to recent studies showing that fake news can spread faster and farther than real news when itâs especially sensational. âThe crazy stuff is more likely to go viral because we're kind of interested in crazy stuff, but this is not surprising historically,â he said. âThe idea that witches live amongst us and should be burned went as viral as anything that Martin Luther said ... Indeed, it turned out that witch burning was more likely to happen in places where there were more printing presses.â In a sobering 90-minute conversation, the author said heâs driven to sleeplessness when he thinks about how some of the dynamics on social media will play out in the future. âI'm much more worried than a non-historian by what I see because history tells me that the polarization process keeps going, and it doesn't just stop at verbal violence because at a certain point that's not satisfying,â Ferguson said. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg meets with a group of entrepreneurs in St. Louis last November. (Jeff Roberson/AP) Enter Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is worth around $64 billion as a 33-year-old because of his brilliance at creating an addictive social network that capitalized on the human desire for connection. The site was already embattled for allowing the Kremlin to use its platform to sow domestic discord. The Russians were literally buying political ads to target American voters with rubles. Now Zuckerberg is under growing scrutiny for the firmâs failure to safeguard data in the wake of damning whistleblower revelations about Cambridge Analytica, a voter profiling firm which harvested the personal information of as many as 50 million users and earned $6 million from President Trumpâs 2016 campaign. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook broke the law or violated a 2011 settlement agreement. A bipartisan chorus in Congress is demanding that Zuckerberg testify under oath. His lobbyists are negotiating the details of an appearance. Recognizing the political risk, Facebook executives have even begun saying publicly that theyâre receptive to being more heavily regulated. âI donât think they have thought deeply at all about the historical significance of their predicament, and I blame Mark Zuckerberg for dropping out of Harvard before he took any of my classes,â Ferguson quipped. âIf he had taken my course in western civilization, he'd know that he's become a strange amalgam of John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and William Randolph Hearst all at once. When you look back on the experience of these figures, what's the common characteristic? They went through a phase of deep unpopularity.â Ferguson, who like Carnegie is a native of Scotland, believes that the American government must move aggressively to rein in the power of companies like Facebook. âIf we don't act, the next phase of the process will be even uglier than the current Cambridge Analytica phase â which is the tip of the iceberg,â he said. âThink of how many other people have downloaded the data. The window was open for years.â He believes Facebook should be treated under the law more like a content publisher than a technology company. Amending the Telecommunications Act of 1996 could increase their liability and make them more accountable for damaging information trafficked on their platforms. âIt is an untenable state of affairs that a few private companies know more about the citizens of a country than the citizens themselves, much less the government,â said Ferguson. âAnd it is untenable that the companies concerned are â¦ so easily instrumentalized by hostile foreign governments that as many people saw Russian-originated content in 2016 as voted in the presidential election. Regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, you cannot possibly think this is okay.â Despite all the attention paid to the ongoing Russia probes, Ferguson thinks media coverage of the midterms needs to emphasize how vulnerable the Internet remains to manipulation by the forces of darkness. âIt's as if people who work professionally in politics just want to pretend that it's still pre-2008, whereas the entire system of politics has completely changed,â he said. âFacebook advertising is the most powerful tool in politics. I don't think we're doing nearly enough to avoid another legitimacy crisis around this.â -- Kim Jong Un did meet with the Chinese president in Beijing, Chinese and North Korea state media confirmed. The âunofficial visitâ is believed to be Kim's first trip abroad since coming to power in 2011. Emily Rauhala reports: âIn Washington, [Sarah Huckabee Sanders] said that the Chinese government had briefed the Trump administration about the visit â¦The Trump administration sees the development âas further evidence that our campaign of maximum pressure is creating the appropriate atmosphere for dialogue â¦ â [Sanders added]. Kim is expected to meet [South Korean President Moon Jae-in] next month, and is in discussions about talks with Trump â¦ \" -- Trump tweeted about his planned meeting with Kim this morning: For years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting! Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me. In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost! -- White House officials said they reached an agreement in principle with Seoul to overhaul the Korea-U.S. trade deal known as KORUS. David J. Lynch writes: âSouth Korea agreed to limit its steel exports to the United States, a key U.S. goal, and take several steps to open its auto market to American companies. In return, Trump agreed to exempt South Korea from his new 25 percent tariff on imported steel. But threatening negotiating partners with tariffs unless they make concessions, as the United States did with South Korea, is not President Trumpâs innovation. It is a tactic that Washington often used before the creation of the World Trade Organization, though one that did little to reduce the bilateral trade deficits that preoccupy the president. It also may prove a riskier strategy when U.S. negotiators take on more-powerful countries, including China â¦ â -- Stormy Danielâs attorney is seeking to depose Trump about his knowledge of an alleged $130,000 payout to the adult-film star. Derek Hawkins reports: âIn documents filed early Wednesday morning, Michael Avenatti said he was seeking to depose Trump and [his lawyer Michael] Cohen for no more than two hours each to find out whether Trump was aware of the agreement and whether he consented to it. Avenatti requested the court hold a hearing on the matter on April 30. The chances of speedy action by a judge on a request of such constitutional magnitude are slim.â GET SMART FAST:ââ Louisiana authorities said the two police officers involved in the fatal 2016 shooting of Alton Sterling will not face criminal charges. The announcement comes nearly two years after Sterlingâs death â and makes his case the latest high-profile police shooting to end without charges for officers. (Mark Berman and Wesley Lowery) Californiaâs attorney general said his office will investigate the fatal police shooting of Stephon Clark. Attorney General Xavier Becerra also said the California Department of Justice will review Sacramentoâs use of force policies and other training procedures after Clark, an unarmed black man, was shot at least 20 times in his own backyard. (New York Times) Several major health groups sued the FDA for delaying certain e-cigarette and cigar regulations until 2021.

(Lindsey Bever) Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin. (Jose Luis Magana/AP) PERSONNEL IS POLICY: -- For weeks, Trump has told advisers he wants to oust David Shulkin, subjecting the VA secretary to âpresidential purgatory.âLisa Rein, Josh Dawsey and Emily Wax-Thibodeaux report: âThe uncertainty has left the leader of the federal governmentâs second-largest agency, its employees and even senior White House officials wondering if Shulkin still officially speaks for VA. It has raised questions, too, about whatâs being done to restore order at the agency after weeks of turmoil have left little doubt that Shulkin â¦ is next to go in whatâs become a pronounced leadership shake-up. Whatâs befallen Shulkin is a favorite tactic of Trumpâs, who followed a similar approach with [Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster] â¦ The president emasculates those who fall from favor, humiliating them through media leaks and in disparaging comments to friends. The mixed signals often leave even senior White House officials guessing who will be fired and when.â -- The State Department is bracing for the return of incoming national security adviser John Bolton, with diplomats rehashing stories about the former U.N. adviserâs aggressive management style and prolific broadsides against the Foreign Service. John Hudson reports: âIn his new job, Bolton will not directly oversee the State Department, but his powerful perch [will] offer opportunities to shape and influence policy and personnel at Foggy Bottom. Boltonâs advisers and former colleagues say he has a good relationship with [secretary of state nominee Mike Pompeo]. But they said Bolton is unlikely to take a back seat to the former Kansas congressman on the issues he cares about most: Iran and North Korea â¦ How Bolton will fit into a combustible Cabinet ecosystem of strong personalities â¦ is unclear, but contemporaries of Bolton said he should not be underestimated.Individuals close to Bolton said they [expect] him to âclear houseâ at the NSC and remove staffers viewed as allies of H.R. McMaster or the previous administration.â âHis style will be to run an imperial NSC where the State and Defense departments are there to implement White House policy,â said longtime Bolton adviser Mark Groombridge. -- Bolton laid out an aggressive response to Russiaâs election interference in a speech made weeks before Trump selected him as national security adviser. Josh Rogin writes: âThe Trump administration has not done enough to respond to Russiaâs attack on the United States and our democratic institutions, Bolton said [last month at the Daniel Morgan Graduate School of National Security], and Putin must pay a heavy price for his actions. â¦ The United States should respond in âcyberspace and elsewhere,â Bolton said, suggesting offensive action against the Russian operatives that perpetrated the interference. Only if the response is overwhelming will Russia and other countries be deterred. â¦ But Bolton doesnât want Trump to stop there. As he explained during his extensive remarks, the United States should also push back on a range of Kremlin transgressions: its support for Syria, its alliance with Iran, its undermining of North Korea sanctions, and its coordination with China to thwart the West.â -- White House budget director Mick Mulvaney is poised to get greater control over Treasury Department regulations. Politicoâs Nancy Cook and Aaron Lorenzo report: âThe move, which could come in the next few weeks, would end the autonomy the Treasury Department has enjoyed since the 1980s when it comes to issuing tax rules, while giving greater power to one of Trumpâs favorite Cabinet members at the expense of another. The highly sensitive debate has consumed the attention of top officials at both agencies. At stake is the final say over IRS regulations â and the implementation of the Republicansâ tax law.â -- Jared Kushnerâs lawyer, Abbe Lowell, told CBS News the White House counsel has concluded $500 million in loans made to Kushnerâs family real estate business present âno issues involving Jared.â Lowell said: â[Kushner] was not involved with his former company after he entered government service; the transactions in question came after that; he had nothing to do with those transactions; the transactions had nothing to do with any of his meetings in the White House, and the people from the companies involved have confirmed that as well.â -- The White House press office has hired former Disney Channel star Caroline Sunshine as a press assistant. Sunshine played Tinka Hessenheffer in âShake It Up,â a Disney show that ran from 2010 to 2013, and previously interned at the White House. (CNN) THE IMMIGRATION AGENDA: -- Trump is privately pushing the U.S. military to foot the bill on construction of a border wall. Josh Dawsey and Mike DeBonis report: âTrump has told advisers that he was spurned in a large spending bill last week when lawmakers appropriated only $1.6 billion for the border wall. He has suggested to [Defense Secretary Jim Mattis] and congressional leaders that the Pentagon could fund the sprawling project, citing a ânational securityâ risk. After floating the notion to several advisers last week, Trump told [Paul Ryan] that the military should pay for the wall[.] Ryan offered little reaction to the idea â¦ but senior Capitol Hill officials later said it was an unlikely prospect. In another interaction with senior aides last week, Trump noted that the Defense Department was getting so much money as part of the spending bill that the Pentagon could surely afford the border wall â¦ The Pentagon has plenty of money, but reprogramming it for a wall would require votes in Congress that the president does not seem to have. Taking money from the 2018 budget for the wall would require an act of Congress[.]â Sarah Huckabee Sanders deflected a question about using dedicated military funds for the wall: âI canât get into the specifics of that at this point, but I can tell you that the continuation of building the wall is ongoing, and weâre going to continue moving forward in that process,â she told reporters. -- The administrationâs decision to add a census question on citizenship has sparked political and legal backlash, mostly recently from New York, which promised a âmultistateâ lawsuit challenging the policy. From Seung Min Kim and Tara Bahrampour: â[T]here is little [Democratic lawmakers] can do to immediately counter the move. The massive spending bill lawmakers passed last week would have been the best chance the minority party had this year to try to block the Census Bureau from moving forward with its plan, with congressional Republicans so far showing little appetite to protest the decision. The confrontation becomes another key factor hanging in the balance in the upcoming midterm elections, with Democrats gaining considerable leverage to scrap the census decision should they win control of either chamber.â -- CNNâs Harry Enten crunched the numbers to find out how blue states would be affected by the citizenship question: âAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, there are 13 million non-citizens living in states (and Washington DC) won by Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. There are only about 9.5 million non-citizens living in states won by Republican Donald Trump. In other words, about 58% of non-citizens live in Clinton states and 42% live in Trump states. These percentages, however, undersell the political impact to blue states. The vast majority of the states to be impacted are blue states. Clinton-won states make up 76% of the states where there are more non-citizens than the average state to Trump's 24%. â¦ âCalifornia and blue states in general could definitely lose seats in Congress too if non-citizens (here legally or illegally) are afraid to answer the Census. Let's say every non-citizen were afraid to answer Census. That's unlikely to happen, but it gives you a good idea of the stakes. â¦ The 2016 American Community Survey suggests California could lose up to four seats in Congress in such a scenario. No other state would lose more than one.â -- Trump terminated deportation protections for 4,000 Liberians, who first received temporary protected status 27 years ago. From USA Todayâs Alan Gomez: âLiberians were first granted TPS in March 1991 under former President George H.W. Bush due to armed conflicts that were gripping the country. Starting in 1999, Liberians were transferred into a separate program called Deferred Enforced Departure, a classification that allowed them to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation. That status was approved several times by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama as the country grappled with a civil war, ongoing armed conflicts, and an outbreak of the Ebola virus. But on Tuesday, after consulting with the departments of State and Homeland Security, Trump concluded that those conditions had been largely resolved. Liberians will have 12 months to get their affairs in order and return to their home country.â -- The Orange County Sheriffâs Department is moving to sidestep California State Bill 54, which restricts communication between federal immigration authorities and local law enforcement. Alex Horton reports: â[The sheriffâs office said] it would put the date an inmate will be released on its website. âThis action will enhance communication between the Sheriffâs Department and our law enforcement partners to remove dangerous offenders from our community,â the department said in a statement â¦ But critics say the measure will cast too wide a net and hand ICE information on the whereabouts of undocumented immigrants who may never be charged with a crime.â Christopher Steele. (Victoria Jones/AP) THEREâS A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- An employee of Palantir Technologies, owned by Peter Thiel, helped Cambridge Analytica to develop its data-gathering practices. The New York Timesâs Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg report: âIt was a Palantir employee in London, working closely with the data scientists building Cambridgeâs psychological profiling technology, who suggested the scientists create their own app â a mobile-phone-based personality quiz â to gain access to Facebook usersâ friend networks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. Cambridge ultimately took a similar approach. By early summer, the company found a university researcher to harvest data using a personality questionnaire and Facebook app.â -- Christopher Steele, the former MI6 officer who wrote the Trump dossier, provided the FBI with another secret report that claimed Vladimir Putinâs former media czar was beaten to death at a D.C. hotel in 2015. This directly contradicts the U.S. governmentâs official finding that Mikhail Lesin died by âaccident.â BuzzFeed News reports Lesin died âon the eve of a scheduled meeting with US Justice Department officials. They had planned to interview Lesin about the inner workings of RT, the Kremlin-funded network that he founded. â¦ The Steele report is not the FBI's only source for this account of Lesin's death: Three other people, acting independently â¦ said they also told the FBI that Lesin had been bludgeoned to death by enforcers working for the same oligarch named by Steele.â -- The dearth of top talent on Trumpâs legal team has led to the promotion of a little-known former prosecutor, Reutersâs Karen Freifeld reports. âAndrew Ekonomou, 69, is one of a handful of lawyers assisting Jay Sekulow, the main attorney representing Trump in [Muellerâs] investigation. .... Sekulow said Ekonomou, who works under contract as an assistant district attorney in Brunswick, Georgia, was a âbrilliant strategistâ who has handled complex investigations for decades. Ekonomou assisted Sekulow in a famous case involving the religious group Jews for Jesus before the Supreme Court in the 1980s. While Ekonomou has also worked on criminal matters, he has not handled cases as high-profile and complex as the Mueller probe.â -- A bipartisan pair of senators who wrote a bill meant to protect Muellerâs investigation issued a statement urging Trump not to interfere with the special counsel. Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) said: âThis should not be a partisan issue. â¦ We urge President Trump to allow the Special Counsel to complete his work without impediment, which is in the best interest of the American people, the President, and our nation.â (Politico) -- Robert Muellerâs team claimed in a court filing it has connected Rick Gates to a person with Russian intelligence ties. CNNâs Katelyn Polantz reports: âThat Gates and the unnamed person, who had lived in Kiev and Moscow and worked for one of Paul Manafort's companies, were in touch in September and October 2016 was âpertinent to the investigation,â [the court filing said]. The acknowledgment that Gates knew the person had Russian intelligence ties is alleged in a report prosecutors filed about the coming sentencing of [Dutch attorney Alex van der Zwaan]. â¦ [Van der Zwaan] pleaded guilty last month to lying to [Mueller's] investigators about his interactions with Gates and the unnamed person.â -- Paul Manafort is asking for 18 criminal charges against him in Virginia to be thrown out. From Spencer S. Hsu: âManafortâs attorneys in January and again in a longer, 38-page filing Tuesday argued that acting attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein improperly ordered Mueller to investigate âlinks and/or coordinationâ between the Russian government and Trump campaign, as well as âany matters that arose or may arise directly fromâ that investigation.â -- British Prime Minister Theresa May urged her countryâs allies to adopt a âlong-term responseâ to deal with Russiaâs ongoing security threat â speaking just one day after 26 countries announced plans to expel Russian diplomats in retaliation for the poisoning of a former spy. (Reuters) FLORIDA FALLOUT: -- Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a New York Times op-ed arguing for the repeal of the Second Amendment: âConcern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of that amendment, which provides that âa well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.â Today that concern is a relic of the 18th century. For over 200 years after the adoption of the Second Amendment, it was uniformly understood as not placing any limit on either federal or state authority to enact gun control legislation.â -- â[R]arely do we see such an unhelpful, untimely and fanciful idea as the one put forward by [Stevens],â Aaron Blake writes. âThe move might as well be considered an in-kind contribution to the National Rifle Association, to Republicans' efforts to keep the House and Senate in 2018, and to President Trump's 2020 reelection bid. In one fell swoop, Stevens has lent credence to the talking point that the left really just wants to get rid of gun ownership and reasserted the need for gun-rights supporters to prevent his ilk from ever being appointed again (with the most obvious answer being: Vote Republican).â -- Polling shows only 1 in 5 Americans would support such an appeal, Christopher Ingraham notes. âIn February, for instance, the Economist and YouGov asked Americans whether they supported a repeal of the Second Amendment. Twenty-one percent said they favored such a proposal, compared with 60 percent in opposition. The poll does, however, show surprisingly robust support for Second Amendment repeal (39 percent) among Democrats (by contrast, 8 percent of Republicans would support a full repeal).â -- The far-right Internet has circulated memes comparing the Parkland, Fla., survivors to Nazis. From Eli Rosenberg: âAlex Jones, the conservative host of Infowars known for spreading baseless conspiracy theories, depicted two of the most prominent students, Emma GonzÃ¡lez and David Hogg, in a jarring video that spliced images and videos of them into what appeared to be Nazi footage. â¦ Jonesâs staff also played a Hitler speech over video of Hogg speaking at the march. Jones said the images were meant to communicate the âtruly frightening historical iconography that you cannot deny in these parallels of this youth march.ââ -- Margaret Sullivan writes the growing acceptance of such conspiracy theories on the more traditional right underscores the âspreading stainâ of extreme partisanship: âWhat weâre seeing here is a spreading stain, in which conspiracy mongering from the likes of Infowars and, yes, Gateway Pundit is adopted by some elements of the formerly mainstream right and peddled to a receptive audience softened up for decades by Fox News. â¦ There seems to be no floor of indecency that we agree to stay above. As Charlie Warzel, who covers âinformation warsâ for BuzzFeed News, put it recently: Extreme partisanship â pro-Trump media as well as parts of the far left â âis not about intellectual courage. Itâs about winning.ââ THE MIDTERMS: -- Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), who had already ruled out running for Congress again, announced he would remove his name from the GOP primary ballot. Dave Weigel explains: âHad Costello remained on the ballot, he would have faced Greg McCauley, a tax attorney and first-time candidate who began running for a different district in February and jumped into the 6th after the new maps were drawn.â -- The Cook Political Report views McCauley as too conservative for the district and gives the edge to Democrats to pick up the seat. Amber Phillips notes: âDemocrats have two near-certain pickups in Pennsylvania. (The first being Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a special election this month in a district that Trump won by 20 points; Lamb is likely to win in the district in November because of the redrawn lines.) â¦ Put another way: We're entering an election cycle in which every pickup for Democrats matters, and Republican retirements are set to be a major factor in their ability to knock off Republicans.â -- Mitt Romney pointed to his stance on âdreamersâ as an example of how he is more conservative than Trump on certain issues. The Daily Heraldâs Katie England reports: âRomney went so far as to say heâs more conservative on certain issues than President Trump. âFor instance, Iâm a deficit hawk ... That makes me more conservative than a lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats. Iâm also more of a hawk on immigration than even the president. My view was these DACA kids shouldnât all be allowed to stay in the country legally.ââ -- Congressional Republicans are angling for another round of tax cut votes with an eye on the midterms. Politicoâs Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade report: âGOP leaders are weighing a series of votes to make last yearâs temporary tax cuts for individuals permanent, according to Republicans in both chambers. The strategy would portray the party as the guardian of Americansâ paychecks, Republicans say, and buoy the GOP during a brutal election year. Republicans argue they win regardless of whether it culminates with a Rose Garden ceremony: Either Democrats support the legislation, giving the GOP a major legislative accomplishment in its scramble to save its majorities. Or, more likely, Democrats block the bill â allowing Republicans to paint them as opponents of the middle class.â -- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) were in regular contact for days before the âspontaneousâ announcement that Florida had been exempted from the administrationâs offshore drilling expansion. Politicoâs Matt Dixon reports: â[Obtained] documents â¦ contradict the supposed spontaneous event that portrayed Scott as single-handedly securing a politically popular win for Floridaâs environmental future only days after the administration had spelled out a controversial new national five-year plan to boost offshore oil drilling. â¦ The records reaffirm the perception at the time that the Trump administrationâs decision to reverse course and remove Florida from the list was carefully choreographed to give Scott a political win in his widely expected challenge this year to unseat [Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.)].â -- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said he would not campaign against Nelson. âBill Nelson and I have a very good working relationship,â Rubio said, adding, âIâll support the Republican nominee.â (Politico) -- Barack Obama will appear at a May fundraiser for Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), his first fundraising event for an individual candidate since leaving office.

(Oliver Contreras for The Washington Post) GOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE: -- Bloomberg News's Zach Mider reports on Robert Mercerâs secret sojourns to New Mexico â where the enigmatic billionaire and Trump donor has apparently been working as a volunteer police officer.âUntil a few months ago, Mercer, 71, ran what is arguably the worldâs most successful hedge fund. He employs a phalanx of servants and bodyguards and owns a 203-foot yacht named Sea Owl. He was the money behind Breitbart News [and Cambridge] Analytica â¦ What was a guy like that doing in the desert, wearing a gun and a shiny badge? I was surprised when I first heard about Mercerâs sojourns in Lake Arthur, but then Iâm used to his surprises. â¦ There seems to be an inexhaustible supply of incredible-but-true Mercer stories, including his pioneering research that begot Google Translate, his funding of a stockpile of human urine in the Oregon mountains, his million-dollar model train set, and his habit of whistling constantly, even during work meetings. âThe common threads in these stories are a fierce intelligence, a wide-ranging curiosity, and an utter indifference to the judgment of others. The story of his adventures in Lake Arthur, which hasnât been previously reported, adds yet another strand. It shows just how far a man of means will go to get something he canât buy: the right to carry a concealed firearm anywhere in America.â -- Politico, âHow Trump favored Texas over Puerto Rico,â by Danny Vinik: âA [review] of public documents, newly obtained FEMA records and interviews with more than 50 people involved with disaster response indicates that the Trump administration â and the president himself â responded far more aggressively to Texas than to Puerto Rico.â HOT ON THE LEFT âWant to impeach the president? This billionaire is on the case,â from Monica Hesse: âImpeaching President Trump. It was a shoot-the-moon strategy, which very few elected officials had shown interest in pursuing, which would need to be based on information someone (Robert S.

The paper calls it Facebook’s biggest data breach to date. The details come from a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, who said he worked with Aleksandr Kogan, a student at Cambridge University, to obtain the data. Kogan created an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that paid users to take a personality test. Participants had to sign in through their Facebook login and agree to let their data be used for academic purposes. The app went beyond its seemingly stated scope, however, pulling in data from the friends lists of any test-takers. Facebook’s platform policy only allows developers the use of friend data to enhance a user’s personal experience. The app put that data, from more than 50 million profiles in all, to work instead. All the data mined from the app became a vital piece of the software Cambridge Analytica used to profile United States voters and serve them with personalized ads ahead of the 2016 election. The U.K. firm has been credited in the past for playing a key role in Donald Trump’s ascent to the White House. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of peopleâs profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie said. According to The Observer, Facebook “took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals” after learning of the “unprecedented” data harvesting in late 2015. It’s not clear why more drastic steps weren’t taken back then, though yesterday’s action is easier to decode. Facebook’s Friday suspension of Cambridge Analytica from the platform came four days after The Observer asked the social media company for comment on the whistleblower’s story. Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert, was also suspended while the investigation plays out. Wylie provided The Observer with a dossier of evidence illustrating Cambridge Analytica’s misuse of the data, including emails, invoices, contracts, and bank transfers that point to the scope of the breach. Also in the dossier is an August 2016 letter from Facebook lawyers instructing Wylie to destroy any data collected by Global Science Research, Kogan’s front company. The letter arrived just a few days before Stephen K. Bannon, a part owner of Cambridge Analytica and former vice president of the company’s board, signed on as Trump’s campaign manager. Facebook takes the position that data harvested by GSR and Cambridge Analytica doesn’t qualify as a breach. In a statement given to The Observer, the social media company claims Kogan’s app “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” as the info was passed along to third parties. The company also said Kogan’s app was removed in 2015, and anyone with access to the data had to certify that it had been destroyed. That timing doesn’t line up with Wylie’s August 2016 letter, however. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Facebook vice president Paul Grewal said in a statement."}

The lawsuit was filed after Facebook acknowledged it had been logging some Android users' call and text history, but noting it was with their permission. The feature, which allows Facebook to see when a call or text was sent or received, \"has always been opt-in only,\" Facebook said Sunday. The lawsuit, filed by three Facebook users in a Northern California federal court, accuses Facebook of violating several state laws and acts, including the California Constitutional Right to Privacy, the Computer Data Access and Fraud Act and the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act. The lawsuit (see below) seeks class action status. Facebook has said that the feature doesn't collect the contents of calls or texts, and that the information collected isn't sold to third parties. The lawsuit comes as the social media giant has been embroiled in a scandal for the past week after reports of a data analytics firm that worked for the Donald Trump campaign misusing Facebook users' personal information during the 2016 US election. Cambridge Analytica is accused of exploiting the personal data of 50 million Facebook users and using the information to manipulate US voters in the presidential campaign. A Facebook spokesperson said the company is \"looking into these claims.\""}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2 Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still donât know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we wonât until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.

Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics â including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5 For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the companyâs poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebookâs settlement.6 Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are â or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data. We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one.

Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of a University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. Cambridge Analytica, a firm specializing in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target them with political messages, ran data operations for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and former Trump senior adviser Stephen Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called “psychographic” profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States. The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of the investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. Facebook said that Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had liked, as well as some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook’s policies and passed the information to Cambridge and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan’s activities in 2015. The company removed Kogan’s app at the time and demanded certifications from Kogan and Cambridge, and Wylie, that the information he had shared had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to Facebook that they had done so. But Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,” the company said. “If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.” Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment. The company’s methods of data collections have been criticized by other researchers. “Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,” said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/28/facebook-posts/viral-meme-says-1956-republican-platform-was-prett/","title":"Viral meme says 1956 Republican platform was pretty liberal | PolitiFact","text":"Viral meme says 1956 Republican platform was pretty liberal Participants at the 1956 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, which nominated Dwight Eisenhower for president and Richard Nixon for vice president. (Library of Congress) Several readers asked us to check out this social media meme about the 1956 Republican Party platform. Liberals are getting nostalgic about the 1950s Republican agenda -- at least judging by the social media meme several readers recently sent us. The meme, created by the group Occupy Democrats, summarized a few planks from the 1956 Republican Party platform, followed by the wistful comment, \"Share if you miss the good old days!\" Here are the seven planks listed in the meme, which to today’s ear sound more like Democratic talking points: 1. Provide federal assistance to low-income communities; 2. Protect Social Security; 3. Provide asylum for refugees; 4. Extend minimum wage; 5. Improve unemployment benefit system so it covers more people; 6. Strengthen labor laws so workers can more easily join a union; 7. Assure equal pay for equal work regardless of sex. We wondered whether the meme accurately describes these elements of the 1956 platform, and if so, whether the 1956 document contrasts sharply with the most recent party platform in 2012. So we took a closer look. All told, the meme is generally accurate in portraying these seven elements of the 1956 platform, with some caveats. On federal assistance to low-income communities, the 1956 platform said the party would \"promote fully the Republican-sponsored Rural Development Program to broaden the operation and increase the income of low income farm families and help tenant farmers.\" On protecting Social Security, the platform touted the Eisenhower administration’s extension of Social Security to 10 million more workers and benefits hikes for 6.5 million Americans. On refugees, the platform spotlighted the administration’s work in sponsoring the Refugee Relief Act \"to provide asylum for thousands of refugees, expellees and displaced persons,\" promising its \"wholehearted support\" for additional efforts. M. Christine Anderson, a Xavier University historian, noted that many refugees were coming from communist countries in Eastern Europe, so this wasn't an especially controversial issue during the Cold War era. On the minimum wage, the platform notes that the Eisenhower administration raised the minimum wage for more than 2 million workers. It urged extending minimum-wage protections \"to as many more workers as is possible and practicable.\" On improving the unemployment benefit system, the 1956 platform touted the administration’s actions to bring unemployment insurance to 4 million additional workers, and backed efforts to \"improve the effectiveness of the unemployment insurance system.\" On strengthening unions, the platform says the \"protection of the right of workers to organize into unions and to bargain collectively is the firm and permanent policy of the Eisenhower Administration.\" That’s full-throated rhetoric in support of unions -- but the policy reality is a bit more nuanced, said Jennifer Delton, a Skidmore College historian and author of Rethinking the 1950s. The platform did not support unions’ key agenda item that year -- a repeal of states’ ability to pass \"right to work\" laws that would ban compulsory union membership. On equal pay for equal work regardless of sex, the platform says the Eisenhower administration will \"continue to fight … (to) assure equal pay for equal work regardless of sex.\" What the 2012 platform says The party’s 2012 platform is pretty different, both in tone and substance. On federal assistance to low-income communities, the 2012 platform takes a much more skeptical view. \"The federal government’s entire system of public assistance should be reformed to ensure that it promotes work,\" the 2012 platform says, arguing that the system has become overly bureaucratized and discourages work. The 2012 platform also takes a shot at federal low-income housing policy, saying the government \"has spent billions more on poorly designed and ineffective housing assistance programs.\" On Social Security, the platform says current retirees or those approaching retirement should continue to receive Social Security as currently configured. However, it goes on to say that demographic and financial challenges mean that the program is \"long overdue for major change, not just another legislative stopgap that postpones a day of reckoning,\" including the possibility of \"personal investment accounts as supplements to the system.\" The 2012 platform doesn’t address refugees specifically, but it does address immigration. It criticizes President Barack Obama for creating \"a backdoor amnesty program unrecognized in law (and) granting worker authorization to illegal aliens.\" It also says that \"granting amnesty only rewards and encourages more law-breaking,\" and it promises to \"create humane procedures to encourage illegal aliens to return home voluntarily, while enforcing the law against those who overstay their visas.\" The 2012 platform doesn’t mention the minimum wage specifically, but it does place an emphasis on free-market business practices rather than government regulation of labor markets, laying the blame for the nation’s weak economic recovery on \"unprecedented uncertainty in the American free enterprise system due to the overreaching policies of the current administration.\" Even accounting for the nuances of the 1956 platform, the clearest contrast between the two platforms may be in their approach to labor unions. The 2012 platform offers no rhetorical niceties, accusing the Obama administration of \"clinging to antiquated notions of confrontation and concentrating power in the Washington offices of union elites\" and of turning the National Labor Relations Board into \"a partisan advocate for Big Labor, using threats and coercion outside the law to attack businesses.\" The 2012 platform doesn’t mention two of the meme’s seven items from 1956 -- unemployment benefits and equal pay for women. The bottom line, then, is that on most of these issues, the GOP moved to the right between 1956 and 2012, though the degree of that shift has varied somewhat issue by issue. What historians say We asked scholars whether the contrast between the two platforms is noteworthy, and they generally agreed that it was. Delton noted that the Republican Party in the 1950s was divided between moderates (including Eisenhower) and conservatives. She said the moderates controlled the process of platform-writing in 1956, but they threw a few bones to conservatives in certain portions of the document. For instance, the platform said the government wouldn’t sign a treaty or enter into an international agreement in violation of individual rights -- an issue that continues to energize conservatives decades later -- and there’s a plank about a balanced budget, which was seen as a conservative position. The seven items listed in the meme were supported by moderates, Delton said. At the time, she said, \"conservatives would have focused, with horror, on the very items the meme highlights.\" Eisenhower was facing a Democratic Congress in 1956 and didn’t want to try to reverse the New Deal, Anderson said. \"If the point is that Eisenhower was not as extreme as Republicans today, it is accurate.\" Our ruling The meme says the 1956 Republican Party platform supported equal pay, the minimum wage, asylum for refugees, protections for unions and more. That’s generally correct. However, it’s worth noting that other elements of the 1956 platform were considered conservative for that era. Also, some of the issues have changed considerably between 1956 and 2012, such as the shift from focusing on post-war refugees to focusing on illegal immigration. The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

A whistleblower has revealed to the Observer how Cambridge Analytica â a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trumpâs key adviser Steve Bannon â used personal information taken without authorisation in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements. Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: âWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of peopleâs profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.â Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. Profile Cambridge Analytica: the key players Alexander Nix, CEO An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the companyâs elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer. Aleksandr Kogan, data miner Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CAâs data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan. Steve Bannon, former board member A former investment banker turned âalt-rightâ media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trumpâs campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the âpopulist, economic nationalistâ agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out. Robert Mercer, investor Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax. Rebekah Mercer, investor Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her fatherâs billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercerâs three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative megaâdonors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trumpâs presidential campaign. The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data. The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use. However, the app also collected the information of the test-takersâ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebookâs âplatform policyâ allowed only collection of friendsâ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebookâs role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate âinformation warfareâ against the US. Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissionerâs Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum. âWe are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,â said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. âItâs part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing peopleâs personal information to micro-target voters.â On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebookâs external lawyers warned the Observer it was making âfalse and defamatoryâ allegations, and reserved Facebookâs legal position. The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. âResidents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,â she said on Twitter. The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. âThis story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether itâs allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, itâs clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,â he said. Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data. Simon Milner, Facebookâs UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: âThey may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.â Cambridge Analyticaâs chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: âWe do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.â Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agencyâs cybercrime unit and the Information Commissionerâs Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles â mostly belonging to registered US voters â were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower. At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014. The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebookâs own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles. See the full visual That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him. âBecause this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,â the letter said. Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said. âThat to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.â Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: âFacebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and itâs failed in its duties to respect the law. âIt has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasnât. Itâs failed time and time again to be open and transparent.â We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons Christopher Wylie A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan âgained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channelsâ but âdid not subsequently abide by our rulesâ because he passed the information on to third parties. Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. âWe are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,â Paul Grewal, Facebookâs vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted. Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the companyâs terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a âclose working relationshipâ with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps. Quick Guide How the story unfolded In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name. Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic âwarâ on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit. She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britainâs Electoral Commission and the Information Commissionerâs Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analyticaâs use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics. While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players. The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a âtextbook example of bad journalismâ. But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience. Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates. Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Muellerâs probing of the companyâs role in Donald Trumpâs presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live. The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour. The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate. âThe ultimate product of the training set is creating a âgold standardâ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,â the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million âmatchedâ profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further. See the full visual At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firmâs data had come from GSR, Nix said: âWe had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.â Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not. GSR was âled by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Electionsâ, a company spokesman said. SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been âknowingly breachedâ and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election. Steve Bannonâs lawyer said he had no comment because his client âknows nothing about the claims being assertedâ. He added: âThe first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.â He directed inquires to Nix."}

You arrive, hoping you might see familiar faces, but all the other gamblers are people you don't give a crap about. You shrug and head to a slot machine. You crank the lever for the thousandth time, cross your fingers and hope for a win. Surprise: You're still a loser. But you'll be back in an hour -- maybe your luck will change. If you're thinking, \"I want that! Help!\" you've come to the right place. Step 1: Stop over-thinking it Worried about losing touch with old friends? Don't. If you were actually friends -- not mutual stalkers -- you would be chatting over a cup of coffee right now. What about networking? I get it, you don't want to talk to someone you met at a work function over the phone. Here are some other modern options for you: texting and email. (Whew, that was a close one.) And all those groups you're in? Well, there are simply some things you're going to have to give up. Think about the trade-off -- you're getting an hour per day (on average) back. That's 365 hours per year. That's a lot of hours over the course of a lot of years. You're welcome. But I use messenger! Not sure if you've heard but most people have a phone number that you can send text messages to. There's also WhatsApp. (Also, you can deactivate your account and still use Messenger. More on that later.) Step 2: Disconnect those apps (like Spotify) You've probably used Facebook to log into other apps and services dozens of times. And why not? It makes signing up for new things super fast. Problem is, those logins inadvertently burrowed you deeper into Facebook's grasp. It's reversible, but it'll require some time to undo. Here's how: Make a list of all the apps you log into using Facebook. One way to figure this out is to go to Facebook (desktop) > Settings > Apps. Scroll through this list and make note of the apps and websites you still use. One by one, log into those apps. Visit the Settings page and find the option to disconnect from Facebook. This process varies quite a bit, so you might want to Google \"disconnect Facebook from [insert app here]\" to speed things up. It was once nearly impossible to disconnect Facebook from Spotify, but the company recently made it much easier. In Spotify, go to Settings and choose the option to disconnect from Facebook. Now log off. In the login window, hit \"Reset Password.\" Follow the instructions, and you're golden. Step 3: Download all your memories You probably want to keep all your photos, posts, friends and all the other data you accumulated on Facebook. Luckily, saving all that data is really easy. Go to Facebook (desktop) and head to Settings. In that first window, hit \"Download a copy of your Facebook data.\" Follow the instructions and wait while Facebook emails you a downloadable file. Now playing:Watch this: How to download your Facebook data 2:14 Step 4: Delete, deactivate or detach This is the part where boys become men. Girls become women. Caterpillars become... you get the idea. You have three options when it comes to quitting Facebook: Permanently delete your account. This is irreversible -- all your data will be removed, your profile will disappear and you'll need to sign up for Facebook again if you want back in. Deactivate your account. This option is for people who know that, eventually, they'll succumb to their addiction. Deactivating essentially puts your account on hold, so you can restore it to the same state it was in when you left it. This also lets you continue using Facebook Messenger. Detach yourself. I really don't recommend this one. There are very few people in this world who have enough self-control to forgo deleting or deactivating their account in favor of ignoring Facebook. But if your addiction is mild or you were never really into Facebook anyway, this option could work for you. To permanently delete your account, go to this page. To deactivate your account, go here. Just be warned, Facebook uses a weird combination of psychology and desperation to try and prevent you from quitting. If you plan to detach yourself and use self-control to \"quit\" Facebook, here are some tips: Opt out of Facebook's email notifications Minimize your profile by making your Timeline, photos and anything else you can private"}
{"originalUrl":"http://wapo.st/2plx5t2?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.a9c4a6f70d5f","title":"Trump campaign consultant took data about millions of users without their knowledge - The Washington Post","text":"Facebookâs recent suspension of Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that played a key role in President Trumpâs 2016 campaign, highlights the rapid rise of a company that claimed it had reached new heights in marrying the art of political persuasion with the science of big data. Four years after the company began offering Republican political candidates the promise of groundbreaking tools for delivering political messages tailored to the psychological traits of voters, serious questions remain about its tactics and effectiveness. What is clear is that the services Cambridge Analytica offered are increasingly coveted by modern political campaigns. Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates. A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as âa research app used by psychologists.â The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information â including the names of users, their âlikes,â friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests. Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work â including a former Cambridge Analytica employee â said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions. The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates. Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of whatÂ âlikeâ buttons they had hit. âIn 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,â the statement said. Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning. Despite Facebookâs concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trumpâs digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user- Â­experience researcher, according to Facebookâs public website. Some critics said Facebookâs actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trumpâs campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election. âThis is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,â said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. âWhether itâs allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, itâs clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.â Cambridge Analytica â which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the presidentâs former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon â has denied wrongdoing. The company has said itsÂ âpsychometric profilesâ could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters. Â âWe worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebookâs terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,â Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday. The companyâs actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections. In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica. Elizabeth Denham, Britainâs information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data âmay have been illegally acquired and used.â The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. âIt is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,â Denham said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 E.U. referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a BritishÂ parliamentary committee that is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.E.U., a pro-Brexit group. Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebookâs processes for dealing with developers who broke the companyâs rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules â usually because of a story in the news â the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said. Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers. Facebook ârelied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,â Parakilas said. âDuring my 16 months at the company, I donât recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.â Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend.Â âCambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,â said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. Analysts raised legal questions about Facebookâs actions on Saturday, including if it ran afoul of its 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of its agreement, saidÂ Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia. In a statement, Facebook said, âWe reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.â After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry into U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). At first, Cruz campaign officials credited CambridgeâsÂ âpsychographic targetingâ techniques â including its use of Facebook data â with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of Cambridgeâs work.Â The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribersâ likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time. Cambridgeâs work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firmâs data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysisÂ did not bear fruit as hoped.Â Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve asÂ the Trump campaignâs data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trumpâs strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. SCL, Cambridgeâs parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in âsoft power,â or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air. Among its clients: NATOâs Strategic Communications Center of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russiaâs influence in the region. SCLâs main offering, firstÂ developedÂ by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audienceâs values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of âpersuadables,â and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting. In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCLâs defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the companyâs techniques is that it âcan be undertaken covertly.â âAudience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and governmentâs role and/or third parties can be invisible,â he wrote.

Other technology giants have also sparked concern:Â Google,Â Apple,Â Amazon andÂ MicrosoftÂ have all faced objections from users, the public and even government agencies. Because all of these companies provide services relating to computers, there is a tendency to lump them together, calling them âBig Techâ or the âFrightful Fiveâ or even âGAFAâ â the acronym for the first four of them, leaving Microsoft out. Conceiving of âbig techâ as a single industry makes the threat and influence overwhelming. In the US, when an industry gets so large it exerts political pressure on society, people often label the industry as a whole, like âBig Oil,â âBig Tobaccoâ or âBig Pharma.â The so-called big tech companies certainly are big: In 2017, they were the top fiveÂ most valuable public companiesÂ in the US But, as aÂ scholar of the media marketplaceÂ that many of these firms are beginning to explore, I know that lumping them together hides the fact theyâre very separate and distinct â not just as companies, but in terms of their business models and practices. Understanding these companies in their proper business contexts makes it easier to understand their power in the marketplace and society at large. It also suggests ways to assess, regulate and manage that power to protect competition andÂ even democracy itself. Google: Advertising revenue from searches Google and Facebook are most frequently discussed together, likely because of their domination of internet advertising. Together, the two companiesÂ collected 63 per centÂ of US digital advertising dollars in 2017. Both companies earn most of their revenue from advertising: 97 percent forÂ FacebookÂ and 88 percent forÂ GoogleâsÂ parent company Alphabet in 2016. But what they offer to advertisers and what users want from them are very different. Googleâs value proposition is helping users find things. Many â even most â of theÂ 3.5 billionÂ searches Google performs each day arenât monetized at all. Google only gets paid if a searcher clicks on a paid link; the top three results are often labeled as âAds,â in addition to several on the right side of a computer userâs search results screen. Advertisers like Google because they only pay if theirÂ ads are clicked. That is a far better deal than what is offered in traditional media advertising, where payment is for how many people are shown an ad, rather than customersâ responses. In addition, Googleâs position as aÂ leading placeÂ where people look for information on products and services means an ad reaches a consumer exactly at the moment theyâre looking for a product. This timing is more valuable than just showing ads to people in general â so much so that advertisers paid GoogleÂ US$79.38 billionÂ in 2016. Facebook: Ad revenue from attention-grabbing content Facebook operates more like a traditional ad-supported media company. It provides interesting content that attracts an audience, and sells their attention to advertisers â just as television, radio and print have done for decades. The key difference between Facebook and these legacy media businesses is where the content comes from: Rather than Facebook paying to create the material that draws users, the users add it themselves for free, posting personal messages and shared links. Like traditional media, Facebook charges advertisers based on how many people see a message, not on how many take action by clicking. The value Facebook offers over traditional advertising is its ability toÂ target very particular groupsÂ with aÂ customized advertising message. This is precisely the type ofÂ targetingÂ that happened during the 2016 US presidential election, which generated widespread public criticism. Apple: Selling electronic hardware In contrast to the advertising businesses of Google and Facebook, Apple remains a hardware technology company, derivingÂ 84 percentÂ of its 2016 revenue from the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers. The profits on those sales let Apple useÂ very different strategiesÂ than the non-hardware companies with which it is often compared. The profit margins on each device are so substantial itÂ doesnât have to dominateÂ the hardware market the way Google and Facebook control online advertising. Despite the seeming ubiquity of iPhones in some social circles, iPhonesÂ rarely top 20 per centÂ of worldwide phone sales, and account forÂ about 30 per centÂ of US sales. Apple has other elements to its business, too â such as its iTunes music distribution business. But itâs important to keep the relative scale of those elements in mind. Mostly, they areÂ complementary businessesÂ that Apple uses strategically in support of its primary focus as a hardware company. Taken together, iTunes, its App Stores, iBooks Store, Apple Music, Apple Care, Apple Pay and other even more ancillary sales added up toÂ just 11 per centÂ of the companyâs revenue in 2016. Even the companyâs plan to spendÂ $1 billion on original videoÂ is hard to understand, except as a support to branding and marketing efforts that boost its hardware sales. Microsoft and Amazon: Mixed retail, computing and media Much like Apple, Microsoft blends many revenue streams: It sells Surface computers, Azure cloud services, software (like the Microsoft Office Suite), gaming consoles and search engine advertising. The company once stood alone as aÂ poster childÂ for massive technology corporations. Lately, it may draw less attention because competitors like Googleâs G Suite have challenged its market share. Also, Microsoft has not aggressively entered social media, a sector now under great scrutiny. Finally, Amazon also operates in many different business sectors. Primarily, it is a goods retailer: Thatâs whereÂ 70 percentÂ of its annual revenue came from in 2016. Its Amazon Web Services content hosting and cloud computing business contributed 9 per cent, and Amazonâs media businesses provided roughly 18 percent of the companyâs $136 billion of annual revenue. That $24 billion of media revenue is nearly three times that of Netflix, but still not Amazonâs core business. Regulate markets and behavior, not âtechâ Itâs not that these companies are so different as to be unrelated or incomparable to each other. They all involve â to varying degrees â computers and services built on internet connection that provide services to customers in ways that never existed before. All five gather data on their users and analyze behavior using algorithms to create personal experiences in ways that are new and have been challenging for companies with long histories in sectors such as media, transportation or retail to match. But despite simple perception of them all as âtechâ companies, their core revenue sources are clearly different. And those distinctions suggest ways people can understand and respond to anxieties about their growing economic and cultural influence. In fact, what is most concerning is the extent to which these companies arenât in the same businesses: Theyâre not competing with each other, or really anyone else. In prior eras, Americans learned that major industries they first viewed as innovators and economic saviors were more complicated and less magnanimous than initially believed. So now today, big tech isnât unlike everything that came before. In fact, big techÂ isnât really a thingÂ at all. Assessing these companies based on what they do, rather than mythologizing them, is the first step forward."}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2 Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still donât know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we wonât until Facebook comes clean and notifies users. Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach. Cambridge Analyticaâs CEO called the data the âsecret sauceâ that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics â including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5 For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the companyâs poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebookâs settlement.6 Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are â or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data. We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone â including the Trump campaign â who might potentially use this data from Facebookâs platform."}

In reaction to the news, and in light of other issues concerning privacy, censorship and data collection at Facebook, Lisa Lindsley, Capital Markets Advisor for SumOfUs, issued the following statement, calling on Facebookâs Mark Zuckerberg to step down as CEO and Board Chair. âFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should step down. For too long, Mark Zuckerberg has kept users in the dark about how it censors speech, allowed companies like SCL and Cambridge Analytica to take advantage of users on its platform, and collected private user call and text data. This is unacceptable. âLast year, we worked with Facebook shareholders to urge that the company create an independent board chair, warning that the current structure, where Zuckerberg serves as his own boss, was a recipe for disaster. Â âMultiple scandals later, itâs clear that enough is enough. Zuckerberg has proven himself unable or unwilling to protect Facebookâs user data or privacy, which is why we firmly believe that shareholders should take action to remove him as CEO and Board Chair. âItâs time for new leadership at Facebookâone that protects users from unethical data collection, state-sponsored censorship, and privacy violations.â SumOfUs also targeted Mark Zuckerberg with a petition last year over Facebookâs removal of Black Lives Matter-related videos and police violence, and other state-sponsored censorship around the globe.

The Yale economist criticized U.S. President Donald Trump during a Saturday interview in Beijing, calling the U.S. commander-in-chief \"a showman\" who \"obviously relishes\" celebrity, but acts in a way that's \"totally unbecoming for a president.\" But he saved his strongest critique for the apparently increasing likelihood of a trade war between the U.S. and China. U.S. companies, he warned, are not prepared to have China cut out of their supply chains or business models. \"The immediate thing will be an economic crisis because these enterprises are built on long-term planning, they've developed a skilled workforce and ways of doing things. We have to rediscover these things in whatever country after the imports are cut off,\" he told CNBC at the annual China Development Forum. \"It's just chaos: It will slow down development in the future if people think that this kind of thing is likely,\" he added. The U.S. president had also announced tariff plans for up to $60 billion in Chinese imports, although China didn't officially connect its Friday threats of retaliation to that White House action. The U.S. goods threatened by Beijing include wine, fresh fruit, dried fruit and nuts, steel pipes, modified ethanol, and ginseng, the ministry said. Those products could see a 15 percent duty, while a 25 percent tariff could be imposed on U.S. pork and recycled aluminium goods, according to an official statement. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Robert Shiller Shiller said he did not believe there would be a significant inflationary effect to the U.S. from steel and aluminum tariffs, but he warned that heated trade rhetoric from both sides could send the American economy reeling into a recession. \"When you ask about the size of the impact on the economy, I think a lot of it is more psychological than direct, unless they really slam on tariffs,\" he said. The Yale economist pointed to the \"most famous tariff war of all\" during the Great Depression, which he said did not \"plausibly, directly\" affect economic growth \"in a major degree,\" but it may have helped \"destroy confidence\" and willingness to plan for the future. \"It's exactly those 'wait and see' attitudes that cause a recession,\" he explained. 'Totally unbecoming' The global economy has been firing on all cylinders in recent months. A trade war could end that strong momentum, but the last year of growth means there's \"a little capacity to absorb\" any trade-related jitters, Shiller said. By that token, he said, Trump's decision to go on the trade offensive could be deemed \"good timing.\" \"If he did this during 2009 it would have been catastrophic,\" Shiller said. \"But I think his timing is just his own personal timing for this: He's been president for a year, it's about time he does something that gets people's excitement going. He has a philosophy of life that that's what you have to do: If you want to stay famous, celebrity â which he obviously relishes â you've got to be constantly creating news.\" On that point, the Nobel Prize winner recalled Trump's recent Twitter posts about former Vice President Joe Biden. The language of the president's message, Shiller said, \"was like school yard 'I'm going to beat you up.'\" Shiller also questioned the fitness of others in the Trump administration, saying the president \"has hired some extremist people.\" He cited Peter Navarro, the White House trade advisor who wrote books called \"Death by China\" and \"The Coming China Wars.\" \"It seemed to me that no responsible president would give credence to that, but here we are. I think he's a showman who is doing this for political reasons within the U.S.,\" the economist said, pointing to the upcoming midterm elections and Trump's own attempt to get re-elected in 2020."}

Facebook was replying to several media reports which claimed that the social media giant was saving the call and text data of Android users for years. Advertisement A report in technology website Ars Technica said that Android cellphone users have noticed that Facebook has saved a virtual trove of their personal call data. “This past week, a New Zealand man was looking through the data Facebook had collected from him in an archive he had pulled down from the social networking site,” the report said. “While scanning the information Facebook had stored about his contacts, Dylan McKay discovered that Facebook also had about two years’ worth of phone call metadata from his Android phone, including names, phone numbers, and the length of each call made or received,” the report added. However, a Facebook spokesperson pointed out that the call log was “a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts”. The spokesperson added that users give their consent by uploading their contacts, a function that’s optional. People can also delete contact data from their profiles by using a tool available on Web browsers, Facebook stated. Later, Facebook issued a statement saying, “You may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging people’s call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case.” Facebook even explained how users could opt out from giving the social media giant permission to log the contacts. “When you sign up for Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android, or log into Messenger on an Android device, you are given the option to continuously upload your contacts as well as your call and text history,” the company said. “For Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose ‘learn more’ or ‘not now’. On Facebook Lite, the options are to turn it on or ‘skip’. If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information,” Facebook added. The tech giant also said that its users’ information is securely stored and is not sold to third parties. “You are always in control of the information you share with Facebook,” it said.

A whistleblower has revealed to the Observer how Cambridge Analytica â a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trumpâs key adviser Steve Bannon â used personal information taken without authorisation in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements. Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: âWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of peopleâs profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.â Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale.

From 2007 he took over the companyâs elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer. Aleksandr Kogan, data miner Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CAâs data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan. Steve Bannon, former board member A former investment banker turned âalt-rightâ media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trumpâs campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the âpopulist, economic nationalistâ agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out. Robert Mercer, investor Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax. Rebekah Mercer, investor Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her fatherâs billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercerâs three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative megaâdonors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trumpâs presidential campaign. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data. The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use. However, the app also collected the information of the test-takersâ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebookâs âplatform policyâ allowed only collection of friendsâ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebookâs role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate âinformation warfareâ against the US. Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissionerâs Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum. âWe are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,â said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. âItâs part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing peopleâs personal information to micro-target voters.â On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebookâs external lawyers warned the Observer it was making âfalse and defamatoryâ allegations, and reserved Facebookâs legal position. The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. âResidents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,â she said on Twitter. The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. âThis story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether itâs allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, itâs clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,â he said. Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data. Simon Milner, Facebookâs UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: âThey may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.â Cambridge Analyticaâs chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: âWe do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.â Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agencyâs cybercrime unit and the Information Commissionerâs Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles â mostly belonging to registered US voters â were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower. At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014. The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebookâs own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles. That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him. âBecause this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,â the letter said. Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said. âThat to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.â Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: âFacebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and itâs failed in its duties to respect the law. âIt has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasnât. Itâs failed time and time again to be open and transparent.â We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons Christopher Wylie A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan âgained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channelsâ but âdid not subsequently abide by our rulesâ because he passed the information on to third parties. Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. âWe are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,â Paul Grewal, Facebookâs vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted. Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the companyâs terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a âclose working relationshipâ with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps. Quick guide How the story unfolded In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name. Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic âwarâ on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit. She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britainâs Electoral Commission and the Information Commissionerâs Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analyticaâs use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics. While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players. The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a âtextbook example of bad journalismâ. But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience. Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates. Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Muellerâs probing of the companyâs role in Donald Trumpâs presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour. The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate. âThe ultimate product of the training set is creating a âgold standardâ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,â the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million âmatchedâ profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further. At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firmâs data had come from GSR, Nix said: âWe had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.â Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not. GSR was âled by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Electionsâ, a company spokesman said. SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been âknowingly breachedâ and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election. Steve Bannonâs lawyer said he had no comment because his client âknows nothing about the claims being assertedâ. He added: âThe first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.â He directed inquires to Nix.

The data analytics firm that worked with Trump's election team harvested millions of Facebook profile. Facebook's recent suspension of Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that played a key role in President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, highlights the rapid rise of a company that claimed it had reached new heights in marrying the art of political persuasion with the science of big data. Four years after the company began offering Republican political candidates the promise of groundbreaking tools for delivering political messages tailored to the psychological traits of voters, serious questions remain about its tactics and effectiveness. What is clear is that the services Cambridge Analytica offered are increasingly coveted by modern political campaigns. Yet Facebook users had few indications of how their personal data was collected, refashioned and deployed on behalf of candidates. A Cambridge University professor working for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 created an app, called Thisisyourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\" The professor, a Russian American named Aleksandr Kogan, used the app to gain access to demographic information - including the names of users, their \"likes,\" friend lists, and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests. Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. But people familiar with how such systems work - including a former Cambridge Analytica employee - said the app would have given Cambridge access to information on the friends of each of those people, a number that almost certainly reached into the tens of millions. The Observer of London and the New York Times reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to information on 50 million Facebook users, citing internal documents and interviews with former employees and associates. Facebook declined to confirm or deny this number. It issued a statement noting its past actions to limit access to this kind of personal information, which, until changes were made in 2014 and 2015, was routinely available about any users who did not explicitly act to prevent the release of what \"like\" buttons they had hit. \"In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list,\" the statement said. Facebook on Friday banned Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and a former Cambridge employee for improperly sharing the data and failing to destroy it after concerns arose about it in 2015. Facebook had asked the parties back then to certify they would not abuse data, but it did not take further action beyond that warning. Despite Facebook's concerns in 2015, the social network continued to work with Cambridge Analytica. During the presidential election, Facebook employees assisting Donald Trump's digital operation worked in the same office as Cambridge Analytica workers, according to a video by the BBC. One former Cambridge employee, Joseph Chancellor, continues to work at Facebook as a user-experience researcher, according to Facebook's public website. Some critics said Facebook's actions on Friday were an insufficient response to a far-reaching data grab that had informed the decision-making of multiple political operations. Trump's campaign paid Cambridge Analytica at least $6 million for data analysis in the final five months of a close election. \"This is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,\" said Sen. Mark Warner, Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a statement. \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive microtargeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\" Cambridge Analytica - which was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, and once had on its board the president's former senior adviser Stephen Bannon - has denied wrongdoing. The company has said its \"psychometric profiles\" could predict the personality and political leanings of most U.S. voters. \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday. The company's actions in the United States and abroad have generated scrutiny from government investigators in Britain and the United States, who have been looking at Russian interference in elections. In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy, D, said she was opening up a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica. Elizabeth Denham, Britain's information commissioner, also said Saturday that she was investigating whether Facebook data \"may have been illegally acquired and used.\" The investigation is part of a broader probe, launched last year, into how political parties are using data analytics to target voters. \"It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,\" Denham said in a statement. Cambridge Analytica has faced ongoing allegations in Britain that it was involved in the 2016 EU referendum, or Brexit vote. The head of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, recently appeared before a British parliamentary committee which is investigating fake news and denied claims that his company worked for Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit group. Despite years of reports of developers abusing data, Facebook's processes for dealing with developers who broke the company's rules were lax, said two former Facebook employees whose job it was to review data use by third parties. The company does not audit developers who siphon data, the people said. If a developer was found to have broken the rules - usually because of a story in the news - the company would give them a warning or kick them off the platform, but it did not take steps to ensure that data taken inappropriately had been deleted, they said. Sandy Parakilas, a former privacy manager at Facebook, said that during his tenure at Facebook, the company did not conduct a single audit of developers. Facebook \"relied on the word of Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data, rather than conducting an audit, which they had a right to do in the case of Kogan. They did not investigate further even after it became clear that CA had bragged about having 5,000 data points on every American, data which likely came from Facebook. They only banned Kogan and CA yesterday to get in front of the press cycle,\" Parakilas said. \"During my 16 months at the company, I don't recall Facebook ever using its audit rights on a developer.\" Technology researchers also criticized Facebook and Cambridge over the weekend. \"Cambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. Analysts raised legal questions about Facebook's actions on Saturday, including if they ran afoul of their 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That decree specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The question of whether Cambridge used the data from the 270,000 people to mine information about their friends could constitute a breach of their agreement, said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia. In a statement, Facebook said \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\" After launching its services for congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, Cambridge Analytica made a dramatic public entry in to U.S. presidential politics in 2015, working on what was touted at the time as a groundbreaking voter outreach effort on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. At first, Cruz campaign officials credited Cambridge's \"psychographic targeting\" techniques - including its use of Facebook data - with elevating Cruz to the top tier of presidential hopefuls. But later, some officials expressed disappointment in some of the Cambridge work. The company initially surveyed more than 150,000 households across the country and scored respondents using five basic traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Cruz campaign officials said the company developed its correlations in part by using data from Facebook that included subscribers' likes. That data helped make the Cambridge data particularly powerful, campaign officials said at the time. Cambridge's work for the Cruz campaign ultimately proved uneven, according to campaign officials, who said that while the firm's data scientists were impressive, the psychographic analysis did not bear fruit as hoped. Cambridge Analytica then moved on to serve as the Trump campaign's data-science provider. While company officials said they did not have sufficient time to employ psychographics in that campaign, they did data modeling and polling that showed Trump's strength in the industrial Midwest, shaping a homestretch strategy that led to his upset wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. SCL, Cambridge's parent company, has said it has worked in 100 countries, including serving military clients with techniques in \"soft power,\" or persuasion. Nix described it as a modern-day upgrade of early efforts to win over a foreign population by dropping propaganda leaflets from the air. Among its clients: NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, which hired SCL to conduct a two-month training session in 2015 at its Riga, Latvia, facility for NATO personnel, followed by additional sessions in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, officials said. The nearly $1 million contract was financed by Canada, as part of its support to help NATO allies counter Russia's influence in the region. SCL's main offering, first developed by its affiliated London think tank in 1989, involves gathering vast quantities of data about an audience's values, attitudes and beliefs, identifying groups of \"persuadables,\" and then targeting them with tailored messages. SCL began testing the technique on health and development campaigns in Britain in the early 1990s, then branched out into international political consulting and later defense contracting. In a 2015 article for a NATO publication, Steve Tatham, a British military psychological operations expert who leads SCL's defense business outside of the United States, explained that one of the benefits of using the company's techniques is that it \"can be undertaken covertly.\" \"Audience groups are not necessarily aware that they are the research subjects and government's role and/or third parties can be invisible,\" he wrote.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/facebook-cambridge-analytica/555866/","title":"Cambridge Analytica and the Dangers of Facebook Data-Harvesting - The Atlantic","text":"On Friday night, Facebook suspended the account of Cambridge Analytica, the political-data company backed by the billionaire Robert Mercer that consulted on both the Brexit and Trump campaigns. The action came just before The Guardian and The New York Timesdropped major reports in which the whistle-blower Christopher Wylie alleged that Cambridge Analytica had used data that an academic had allegedly improperly exfiltrated from the social network. These new stories, backed by Wylieâs account and internal documents, followed years of reporting by The Guardianand The Intercept about the possible problem. The details could seem Byzantine. Aleksandr Kogan, then a Cambridge academic, founded a company, Global Science Research, and immediately took on a major client, Strategic Communication Laboratories, which eventually gave birth to Cambridge Analytica. (Steve Bannon, an adviser to the company and a former senior adviser to Trump, reportedly picked the name.) The promise of Koganâs company was that they could build psychological profiles of vast numbers of people by using Facebook data. Those profiles, in turn, might be useful to tune the political messages that Cambridge Analytica sent to potential voters. Perhaps a certain kind of message might appeal more to extroverts, or narcissists, or agreeable people. To gather that data, the Times reports, Kogan hired workers through Amazonâs Mechanical Turk to install a Facebook app in their accounts. The app, built by Global Science Research, requested an unusual (but not unheard-of) amount of data about users themselves and their friends. Thatâs how 270,000 Turkers ended up yielding 30 million profiles of American Facebook users that could be matched with other data sets. From the current reporting, it seems that Kogan violated Facebookâs terms of service in saying he was using the data for academic research, but then selling it to Strategic Communications Laboratories. Thatâs what got Cambridge Analytica and Kogan in trouble. (Cambridge Analytica told The Guardian that they do not have possession of the data nor did they use any of this data in the 2016 election. An anonymous source in the Times story disputes this.) Thereâs a lot about Cambridge Analytica that doesnât quite add up. Are they data geniuses who swung the Brexit vote and got Trump elected, or pretenders bluffing their way to fat marketing contracts? Right after the election, several stories pointed to their psychological profiles of voters as a crucial piece of the Trump digital machine. As time has gone on, their role has come to be seen as less important, more in line with the tiny slice of the Trump campaign treasury that they got, roughly $6 million. While the specifics of this particular violation are important to understand, the story reveals deeper truths about the online world that operates through and within Facebook. First, some of Facebookâs growth has been driven by apps, which the company found extended the amount of time that people spent on the platform, as retired users of FarmVille could attest. To draw developers, Facebook had quite lax (or, as one might say, âdeveloper-friendlyâ) data policies for years. Academic researchers began publishing warnings that third-party Facebook apps represented a major possible source of privacy leakage in the early 2010s. Some noted that the privacy risks inherent in sharing data with apps were not at all clear to users. One group termed our new reality âinterdependent privacy,â because your Facebook friends, in part, determine your own level of privacy. For as long as apps have existed, they have asked for a lot of data and people have been prone to give it to them. Back in 2010, Penn State researchers systematically recorded what data the top 1,800 apps on Facebook were asking for. They presented their results in 2011 with the paper âThird-Party Apps on Facebook: Privacy and the Illusion of Control.â The table below shows that 148 apps were asking for permission to access friendsâ information. Pennsylvania State University But thatâs not the only way that friends leak their friendsâ data. Take the example of letting an app see your photos. As the Penn State researchers show, all kinds of data can be harvested: whoâs tagged in photos, who liked any of the pictures, who commented on them, and what they said. If one were to systematically crawl through all the data that could be gleaned from just a userâs basic information, one could build a decent picture of that personâs social world, including a substantial amount of information about their friends. Facebook has tightened up some of its policies in recent years, especially around apps accessing friendsâ data. But TheGuardianâs reporting suggests that the companyâs efforts to restuff Pandoraâs box have been lax. Wylie, the whistleblower, received a letter from Facebook asking him to delete any Facebook data nearly two years after the existence of the data was first reported. âThat to me was the most astonishing thing,â Wylie told The Guardian. âThey waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.â But even if Facebook were maximally aggressive about policing this kind of situation, whatâs done is done. Itâs not just that the data escaped, but that Cambridge Analytica almost certainly learned everything they could from it. As stated in The Guardian, the contract between GSR and Strategic Communications Laboratories states, specifically, âThe ultimate product of the training set is creating a âgold standardâ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information.â Itâs important to dwell on this. Itâs not that this research was supposed to identify every U.S. voter just from this data, but rather to develop a method for sorting people based on Facebookâs profiles. Wylie believes that the data was crucial in building Cambridge Analyticaâs models. It certainly seems possible that once the âtraining setâ had been used to learn how to psychologically profile people, this specific data itself was no longer necessary. But the truth is that no one knows if the Kogan data had much use out in the real world of political campaigning. Psychological profiling sounds nefarious, but the way that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica first attempted to do it may well have proven, as the company maintains, âfruitless.â So what is to be done? Itâs possible that these new stories will cause Facebook to restrict the use of its data by people outside the company, including legitimate researchers. But that kind of self-imposed or external regulation would not strike at whatâs actually scary about these efforts. If Cambridge Analyticaâs targeted advertising works, people worry they could be manipulated with informationâor even thoughtsâthat they did not consent to giving anyone. And societally, a democracy running on micro-targeted political advertisements tuned specifically for ever tinier slices of the population is in trouble, as scholars like Zeynep Tufekci warned in 2012 (and in 2014). Those two concerns extend far beyond Cambridge Analytica. In fact, the best system for micro-targeting ads, political or otherwise, to particularly persuadable segments of the population is Facebook itself. This is why Facebookâs market value is half a trillion dollars. In Facebookâs ad system, there are no restrictions on sending ads to people based on any âtargetableâ attribute, like older men who are interested in the âConfederate States of Americaâ and the National Rifle Association and who are âlikely to engage with political content (conservative).â Thatâs to say nothing of the ability to create databases of people from other sourcesâelectoral rolls, data on purchasing habits or group affiliations, or anything gleaned by the hundreds of online data companiesâthen letting Facebook itself match those people up to their Facebook accounts. Facebook might never reveal the names in an audience to advertisers or political campaigns, but the effects are the same. Facebookâs laxity and the researcherâs malfeasance are newsworthy. But is the problem with privacy-obviating social networks, psychological profiling, and political micro-targeting that some researcher violated Facebookâs terms of service?

The company's stock was down by as much as 6% in Monday trading after the latest development following the disclosure that the data of 50 million users fell into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Shares briefly dipped below $150 for the first time since July 2017. That left the company's market value more than $100bn lower than ten days ago, when reports began to surface about Cambridge Analytica's use of data in Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. However, the shares later fought back to end the session slightly higher, amid a wider Wall Street rally. The FTC's bureau of consumer protection said, in a statement by its acting director Tom Pahl, that it \"takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook\". \"Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices,\" Mr Pahl said. The regulator said that past settlements by companies that had faced FTC action included orders imposing privacy and data security requirements. Reports had previously surfaced last week that it was investigating Facebook, but the watchdog had not confirmed this until now. In the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office has also launched an inquiry. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. Facebook also faces rising discontent from advertisers and users, with US car parts retailer Pep Boys on Monday suspending all advertising on the social network, following a similar move from internet company Mozilla last week. Last week, UK advertisers' body ISBA said it had a \"constructive and challenging\" meeting with the tech giant after it raised concerns over the disclosure. ISBA said it welcomed the steps Facebook had taken to address these concerns. Over the weekend, Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said he expected there were other companies alongside Cambridge Analytica which may have abused their access to large amounts of the social network's data."}

But just one person â with hundreds of friends â allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today. In the earlier stages of a company, it’s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasn’t a breach â though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, here’s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said: Update:Â Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. Here’s his explanation. I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in. I'm going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018. Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data that’s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was “controversial” with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, Trump’s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on theÂ right 50 million people could have made a huge difference. While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwupsÂ and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, it’s hardly alone in that respect. We’ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like Uber’s “god view” and Lyft’s own troubles. It’s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort.Â Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014. To be sure, It doesÂ not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important. Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account ofÂ Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and “questioned whether any data still remained out of its controls” throughout a week of inquiries. This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked. We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so we’ll take that as the current statement for Facebook."}

Arguing that Strategic Communication Laboratories, particularly its subsidiary Cambridge Analytica and some others, violated agreement terms, Facebook says the disbarment is necessary for its attempts to ensure peopleâs information is protected and user data isnât being manipulated. Paul Grewal, Facebookâs vice president and deputy general counsel,Â describesÂ the situation in a blog post: Advertisement - story continues below In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated ourÂ Platform PoliciesÂ by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc. Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, âthisisyourdigitallife,â offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as âa research app used by psychologists.â Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it. But Kogan apparently crossed the line after gaining access to user information in an admittedly âlegitimate way and through proper channelsâ when he passed that data on to SCL — and thus Cambridge Analytica — as well as Wylie. Koganâs app was eventually removed, and Facebook demanded authentic evidence that it deleted all relevant information as it had been told. âSeveral days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,â Grewal continued. âWe are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.â Advertisement - story continues below It seems that Facebook allowed Koganâs app to collect data on friends, and based on features such as âlikes,â because it comported with their efforts to cultivate an environment of increased engagement. But by doing so, Facebook inadvertently gave Kogan powers with unintended consequences, and upon figuring out his tactics and purposes, it barred the aforementioned alleged violators. Kogan wasÂ reportedlyÂ able to create more than 50 million profiles using the trend and characteristics data before providing them to Cambridge. âRules donât matter for them. For them, this is a war, and itâs all fair,â Wylie said of Cambridge, according to The New York Times. âThey want to fight a culture war in America. Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.â Do you think this company helped Trump win the election as Facebook claims?

Tech companies like Google, Twitter, and especially Facebook, have been hammered with criticism from a large portion of the population â including lawmakers â for purportedly helping Trump win the 2016 election with the platformâs inherent offerings. How much social media campaigns actually had an effect on election results appears dubious, or at least unclear, and may not even be quantifiable. What is more clear is that Facebookâs features can help sow seeds of further discord by allowing operators to capitalize on polarization. âNow is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,â Nuala OâConnor, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology, said in a statement. âWhile the misuse of data is not new, what we now see is how seemingly insignificant information about individuals can be used to decide what information they see and influence viewpoints in profound ways.â Advertisement - story continues below SeveralÂ reports, including The New York Timesâ one, are referring to the actions of Cambridge Analytica — which had social media prowess described as the âsecret sauceâ to Trumpâs political campaign — as a data âbreach.â But as noted by Grewal in an update made Saturday morning, âthe claim that this is a data breach is completely falseâ because Kogan requested and gained access through permissible, in fact, standard, means. âEveryone involved gave their consent,â said Grewal. Facebook says it is subjecting all apps that seek personal user information to its App Review process, âwhich requires developers to justify the data theyâre looking to collect and how theyâre going to use it â before theyâre allowed to even ask people for it.â Founded by Tucker Carlson, a 25-year veteran of print and broadcast media, and Neil Patel, former chief policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, The Daily Caller News Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit providing original investigative reporting from a team of professional reporters that operates for the public benefit."}

A whistleblower has revealed to the Observer how Cambridge Analytica â a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trumpâs key adviser Steve Bannon â used personal information taken without authorisation in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements. Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: âWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of peopleâs profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.â Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. Profile Cambridge Analytica: the key players Alexander Nix, CEO An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the companyâs elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer. Aleksandr Kogan, data miner Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CAâs data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan. Steve Bannon, former board member A former investment banker turned âalt-rightâ media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trumpâs campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the âpopulist, economic nationalistâ agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out. Robert Mercer, investor Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax. Rebekah Mercer, investor Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her fatherâs billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercerâs three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative megaâdonors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trumpâs presidential campaign. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data. The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use. However, the app also collected the information of the test-takersâ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebookâs âplatform policyâ allowed only collection of friendsâ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebookâs role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate âinformation warfareâ against the US. Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissionerâs Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum. âWe are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,â said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. âItâs part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing peopleâs personal information to micro-target voters.â On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebookâs external lawyers warned the Observer it was making âfalse and defamatoryâ allegations, and reserved Facebookâs legal position. The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. âResidents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,â she said on Twitter. The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. âThis story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether itâs allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, itâs clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,â he said. Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data. Simon Milner, Facebookâs UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: âThey may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.â Cambridge Analyticaâs chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: âWe do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.â Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agencyâs cybercrime unit and the Information Commissionerâs Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles â mostly belonging to registered US voters â were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower. At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014. The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebookâs own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles. That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him. âBecause this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,â the letter said. Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said. âThat to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.â Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: âFacebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and itâs failed in its duties to respect the law. âIt has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasnât. Itâs failed time and time again to be open and transparent.â We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons Christopher Wylie A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan âgained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channelsâ but âdid not subsequently abide by our rulesâ because he passed the information on to third parties. Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. âWe are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,â Paul Grewal, Facebookâs vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted. Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the companyâs terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a âclose working relationshipâ with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps. Quick guide How the story unfolded In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name. Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic âwarâ on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit. She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britainâs Electoral Commission and the Information Commissionerâs Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analyticaâs use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics. While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players. The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a âtextbook example of bad journalismâ. But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience. Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates. Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Muellerâs probing of the companyâs role in Donald Trumpâs presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour. The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate. âThe ultimate product of the training set is creating a âgold standardâ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,â the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million âmatchedâ profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further. At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firmâs data had come from GSR, Nix said: âWe had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.â Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not. GSR was âled by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Electionsâ, a company spokesman said. SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been âknowingly breachedâ and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election. Steve Bannonâs lawyer said he had no comment because his client âknows nothing about the claims being assertedâ. He added: âThe first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.â He directed inquires to Nix.

Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform, but is under huge political pressure to explain how it can stop third parties from abusing its massive data trove. Facebook’s share price has dropped 4.05% in pre-market trading, likely thanks to the news that political research firm Cambridge Analytica used its site to harvest 50 million user profiles illegitimately. According to Markets Insider, Facebook’s share price stands at $177.60 in pre-market trading, down from a $185.09 at close on Friday. The drop wipes around $21 million off Facebook’s market cap. Lawmakers in the US and the UK are examining Facebook and its role in election interference Facebook is under huge pressure from lawmakers in the US and UK over the way it handles user data, and how that data might be manipulated for targeted political advertising. A former Cambridge Analytica employee, Christopher Wylie, blew the whistle, saying: “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.” Cambridge Analytica managed to access the data after teaming up with a University of Cambridge psychology professor, Aleksandr Kogan, and his company Global Science Research (GSR) in 2014. GSR had developed an app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” which examined what people “liked” on Facebook. Cambridge Analytica and GSR paid around 270,000 people to download the app and take the personality test – but the app also syphoned off data about the users’ friends. Facebook eventually became aware of the app, and asked GSR and Cambridge Analytica to delete all the data they held on users. But The New York Times found Cambridge Analytica still held most of the data. Facebook suspended the company from its platform on Friday, prior to the full revelations becoming public but after it had been notified that the story was being published. And Damian Collins, the British politician overseeing a select committee investigation into fake news, said on Sunday that Cambridge Analytica and “deliberately mislead [sic]” MPs over its use of Facebook data. He also said Facebook executives had tried to avoid tough questions over its role in spreading fake news and election interference. “Alexander Nix denied to the Committee last month that his company had received any data from the Global Science Research company (GSR). From the evidence that has been published by The Guardian and The Observer this weekend, it seems clear that he has deliberately mislead the Committee and Parliament by giving false statements,” he said.” He added: “I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry. It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook’s stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.”"}

We expect there are others,\" he stated. \"And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.\" The ads contained no mention of the political consultancy accused of using the leaked data, Cambridge Analytica, which worked on US President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. The British firm has denied wrongdoing. What is the row about? In 2014, Facebook invited users to find out their personality type via a quiz developed by Cambridge University researcher, Dr Alexsandr Kogan called This is Your Digital Life. About 270,000 users' data was collected, but the app also collected some public data from users' friends without their knowledge. Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can gather in this way, but a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, says the data of about 50 million people was harvested for Cambridge Analytica before the rules on user consent were tightened up. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Facebook has said Dr Kogan passed this information on to Cambridge Analytica without its knowledge. And Cambridge Analytica has blamed Dr Kogan for any potential breach of data rules. But Dr Kogan has said he was told by Cambridge Analytica everything they had done was legal, and that he was being made a \"scapegoat\" by the firm and Facebook. Did Facebook get a warning seven years ago? As first reported in the Sunday Telegraph, Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) warned Facebook's security policies were too weak to stop abuse in 2011, some three years before the breach took place. Following an audit, the DPC said relying on developers to follow information rules in some cases was not good enough \"to ensure security of user data\". It also said Facebook processes to stop abuse were not strong enough to \"assure users of the security of their data once they have third party apps enabled\". Facebook said it strengthened its protections following the recommendations and was told it had addressed the DPC's original concerns after a second audit in 2012. The tech firm also said it changed its platform entirely in 2014 with the regulator's recommendations in mind."}

{"originalUrl":"https://umustknowaboutit.blogspot.co.uk/2018/03/the-cambridge-analytica-and-facebook.html?m=1","title":"You must know about it","text":"Subscribe to this blog Follow by Email This is a famous quote given by Clive Humby, founder of Dunnhumby, a marketing analytics firm. When he was working on some data to provide insights to the firm he was working for, he realized that data can be as powerful a source as oil for business in coming future. And he was absolutely right. We can see nowadays how much Data Industry has grown. This is what we have witnessed in Facebook case. Facebook has been all over the news due to Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaign’s data firm, was involved in a data collection scheme. This allowed Cambridge Analytica access to the private information of over 50 million Facebook users. We discuss what you need to know about this recent scandal, and what it means for Facebook users WHAT IS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA? Cambridge Analytica is a data firm that offers companies and political parties services to “change audience behavior”. The purpose of CA is to come up with online political campaigns, reach out to potential voters online and it does this by combining data from multiple sources including online information. It is also the firm that worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign as well as with the Leave EU camp during Brexit. The firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, in order to target them with personalized political advertisements. my personality MyPersonality was the application Cambridge Analytica used to harvest the information. It was a popular Facebook personality quiz that could be used to build psychological profiles of the people who took the quiz, and, due to a loophole in Facebook API, allowed it to collect data from the Facebook “friends” of the quiz takers as well. Who is Christopher Wylie and what are his allegations? Christopher Wylie is the co-founder and former research lead at Cambridge Analytica, who blew the whistle on CA's unethical activities. Speaking to The Guardian, Wylie said that the company exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles and used that to build models to target these same people. According to Wylie, Facebook suspended his account for his act of blowing the whistle on something that Facebook knew privately for about two years. What's Facebook's response? \"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" said Facebook. On the topic of the data of friends also being compromised, Facebook's 'platform policy' allows only the collection of friends' data to improve the in-app user experience and this data is not meant to be sold outside. For now, Facebook has suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica, Dr. Alexsandr Kogan, and Christopher Wylie, till further investigations. How is it related to the Trump election campaign? CA was hired by the Trump campaign to help with data crunching during the 2016 election season. CA guided Trump's campaign team on how best to target voters using ads or speeches or making the strategic campaign stops. While this may look like any other service persuading voters to vote for their party, according to Wiley what CA did was manipulating voters into voting for Trump Who is Facebook answerable to now? Facebook is already facing the music in the US with regards to the involvement of Russian entities in gaming Facebook's ad platform. This revelation can only make things worse for Facebook. Even though Facebook says that there isn't a data breach Cambridge Analytica eyeing India According to a report in Hindustan Times, the UK-based firm has its eyes on South-Asian countries such as India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as they approach elections. The report states that CA and its India partner Oveleno Business Intelligence (OBI) have reached out to Congress and BJP for a possible collaboration for the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Facebook Users It certainly sparks a larger debate for Facebook’s 2.2 billion active users—how safe is their personal data? And how is it being used? Facebook allowed a third-party to implement an application for the sole purpose of gathering user’s data. Furthermore, Facebook has known about this issue for more than two years, and only now that it has been made public are they acknowledging their mistake. Facebook has publicly touted their ability to accurately profile voters using the information they give to the site. What happens now? The extent of the data breach is still not fully known. Whether Facebook and Cambridge Analytica will take the legal route is something that only time will tell.As it is, Facebook and a lot of social media websites have been facing the music from governments especially in the US, the UK as well as the EU. This data breach will only strengthen the voices of critics who are asking for more regulation of social media. Popular posts from this blog Law of \"Unanticipated Consequences\" One of the most powerful laws in economics is the law of unintended consequences. As formulated by the American sociologist Robert Merton in a 1936 paper called “The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action,” it says that consequences “are occasioned by the interplay of forces and circumstances which are so complex and numerous that prediction of them is quite beyond our reach.” What are Tariff Barriers? It’s well understood that tariffs on imported goods raise prices for domestic businesses and consumers. What’s less familiar is that tariffs are blunt instruments that strike every nation in a supply chain, not just the ones being targeted.

Chinese producers buy iron ore for steel from Australia, Brazil, India, Iran, South Africa, and Ukraine, and bauxite for aluminum from Australia, Brazil, and t… In 2009, the government of India launched a new identification programthat has gone on to become the largest biometric database in the world. The program, known as Aadhaar, has collected the names, addresses, phone numbers—and perhaps more significantly, fingerprints, photographs, and iris scans—of more than 1 billion people. In the process, Aadhaar has taken on a role in virtually all parts of day-to-day life in India, from schools to hospitals to banks, and has opened up pathways to a kind of large-scale data collection that has never existed before. The Indian government views Aadhaar as a key solution for a myriad number of societal challenges, but critics see it as a step toward a surveillance state. Now, the Aadhaar experiment faces a significant threat from the Indian Supreme Court. Privacy had emerged as a contentious issue while the apex court was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the Centre’s move to make Aadhaar mandatory for availing government schemes.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2 Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still donât know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we wonât until Facebook comes clean and notifies users. Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach. Cambridge Analyticaâs CEO called the data the âsecret sauceâ that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics â including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5 For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the companyâs poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebookâs settlement.6 Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are â or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data. We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone â including the Trump campaign â who might potentially use this data from Facebookâs platform."}

Kogan, according to Facebook, obtained information on 270,000 Facebook users via his app, which he touted as a research experiment.Â But though the app itself was apparently in line with Facebook's developer policies, what Kogan did with the data he collected wasn't. According to Facebook's deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, Kogan then gave the data he acquired via his app to Cambridge Analytica and another third-party company. Facebook's policies prohibit developers from turning user data over to third parties. Grewal says the company found out about Kogan's actions in 2015 and removed his app and \"demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.\" They certified deleting user data they received from an app developer in 2015 but we have since learned that not all of it may have been removed. This is a clear violation of our policies and terms of service. Everyone involved claimed they had destroyed the data, but Facebook now says they have reason to believe not all the data was actually destroyed. And they've banned Kogan and Cambridge Analytica while they investigate. It's not clear if the ban is meant to be temporary or permanent, but it's an unprecedented move for Facebook to publicly announce such a suspension.

Some readers have confirmed my take that this is illegal under common carrier regulations, and separately also not be allowed under the recent New York state copper settlement agreement. But Verizon appears to be taking advantage of the fact that the deal has been agreed but not yet approved by a court to establish “facts on the ground.” So I’m still limping on the connectivity. Both my options, FIOS and Spectrum, get generally crappy reviews and have bad customer service. My experience with cable, and it seems to be true with FIOS, is they have just as many outages as DSL, and the outages last longer when they happen. I know some readers have piped up and claimed they’ve never had outages, but my building staff says tenants have complained about both FIOS and Spectrum outages. There are more complaints re FIOS, but that could be sample bias (with only 65 units in my building, having even one or two tenants with high service expectations on one or the other would skew results) or the caliber of customer service once you have an outage v. the amount of actual downtime. The latter is far and away the most important consideration for me, and despite DSL being antique, it performed well, including relative to cable from Spectrum when I’ve been staying with family or friends who use that for their broadband. (And do not forget that I listed wanting POTS for safety as a big reason to want to stick with copper, but that’s beside the point going forward.) But for NYC readers only: If you have FIOS or Spectrum, how many outages have you had in the pst year or two? How long have they typically been? And can you get answers from tech support or customer service when they happen? (See Terry Pratchett’s The Truth for a discussion of “fracas” vs. “rumpus.”) I’m actually a little baffled about where to file this material, since as an event the fracas begins as a “2016 Post Mortem,” but then ramifies outward to questions of valuation, the melding of the press, opposition researchers, the political class, and the intelligence community, besides raising privacy issues. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (âBecause marketsâ). I donât much care about the âismâ that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I donât much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue â and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me â is the tens of thousands of excess âdeaths from despair,â as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics â even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clintonâs wars created â bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow â currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press â a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; letâs call such voices âthe left.â Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isnât allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since Iâve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Post navigation 189 comments Another reason why I view going to major eastern seaboard cities akin to visiting third-world countries when I travel there from upstate NY. I was just visiting one of my kids in another eastern seaboard major city last week and had numerous, numerous disconnects of my VPN so I spent half of my work time just reconnecting to the Comcast wifi. Returned to FIOS in upstate NY and no more disconnects. So internet, traffic jams, incredibly crappy roads (especially in NYC), unbelievable bureaucracy (hello NYC Department of Buildings), mass transit that often has delays, fires etc. all give these cities a distinct third-world flair. Fabulous for the 1%, not so good for the rest. I avoid eastern seaboard airports like the plague for connections due to frequent delays, missed connections, and generally poor airports, Flying through select “fly-over” hubs is usually much more reliable. Agreed. I live upstate and have reached similar conclusions. Which is saying a lot given the fact that this region has been clobbered pretty hard over the past 40 years in the global/gig economy. But is there any region or city that does function pretty well? Maybe Minneapolis? Or not. Most of the Fortune 100 plants in our area closed in the 80s and early 90s. By 2008, the old plants were actually filling up pretty well with small businesses, so we didn’t go through massive layoffs unlike the early 90s. House prices didn’t go up in the housing bubble and didn’t go down in the housing crash. A $60k income will buy you a decent home in a decent school district. In 2009 I was laughing about the fact that our economy had sucked for so long that we had adapted and we now had a diversified economy that many other areas now wanted. Many people left the area, especially the younger folks, but if you have a good job, either blue collar or professional, then you can live comfortably. The poor in the urban centers and rural areas can be very poor with a lot of family challenges. However, a full-time job a couple of dollars above minimum wage can pull you into lower middle-class, especially if you do not have a child. In general, I would say we have been in an equilibrium state for about 15-20 years. Local taxes are way too high, mainly because the county taxes pick up a big chunk of the NYS Medicaid funding. Shifting that to the General Funds would completely change the picture on local taxes and make these areas much more competitive. Yikes, sounds like life is a lot worse in the big coastal cities than in Canada. It used to be that well off people in Canada, especially Atlantic Canada, would move to the US because the opportunitues and living standards were just better than what Canada had to offer. For a very long time, Canadians were worried about the risk of a massive brain drain. With the exception of the technology industry, where many Canadian graduates move to San Francisco or Seattle to work for companies like Google or Amazon, that doesn’t happen as often now. Our telecommunications giants in Canada are quite bad, but I hear that the American giants like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon are far worse. You do get the feeling that the US is regressing in many ways. Poor quality infrastructure that is in a state of decay, a much weak social safety net, constant fear of illness, high rates of gun related fatalities, dysfunctional government, police forces that are excessively warlike, and for many, the declining state of living resemble a developing country. I’m glad my family moved, but it seems like it is creeping northwards and into Europe as well. Canadians believe government can actually function which many Americans don’t believe. As a result, many Americans work hard to disprove that government can actually function. This appears to be one of the best explanations of the current Congress. Canada developed a social contract over the past 60 years where Canadians pay taxes and expect to get decent government functions, including universal health care. That struggled in the late 70s and 80s but seems to have rebounded over the past 20 years or so. I live in a small city in upstate NY on the PA border. I’ve had Time Warner now Spectrum internet service for 6 years. It has only been out once for about 2 hours. I have two complaints.It is expensive. The other is they advertise 100 mbps starting speeds. When I test mine , the best I get is 37 mbps. NY Times article on racismâs effect on Black boys is worth careful reading and thought. For me, it argues for major and long-term work to make neighborhoods healthier places to live, meaning places with good schools, access to capital to finance local businesses and community institutions, amenities, safety. In other words, places where kids thrive. Two notes about FIOS service that probably apply, even though I live in Maryland. YOU are responsible for replacing the backup battery in the unit, and in my experience, they need replacement more often and don’t power the unit as long as the Verizon states. OTOH, I was surprised to discover that my FIOS box works with my old, dial telephone. My problem is with the local power company, Southern California Edison. In the last three months or so, they have had scheduled power outage three times already. No idea what they are doing, but that seems a little too often. Edison scheduled an all-day outage here a few weeks back. It was on a Monday from 8AM to 4PM. As I work from home, I pushed projects back and planned on spending the day reading a book. 8AM came, no outage. Visited the Socaled website, no explanation. The power stayed on all day. My WAG is that they are performing much deferred distribution system upgrades to make up for under investment over the last decade and deal with a truly difficult to manage surge in rooftop PV (which at higher penetrations such as what CA is beginning to see can introduce all sorts of difficulties). Although I would guess PG&E might be in worse shape than SCE in terms of deferred capital investment because of their early 00s bankruptcy. You can do a search of reviews just for your zipcode. If you click on a review youâll see a scale to the right which also includes a scale on connection reliability. See http://www.dslreports.com/reviews. Enter your zipcode and then just click on the first âgoâ button, after the âTechâ dropdown â you donât even need to select anything in that dropdown unless you want to filter the results even more. The results are limited to recent reviews; so youâre not getting reviews that go far back in time. I switched from Verizon DSL to Spectrum in 2015: I’ve only experienced one lengthy outage (according to news reports the problem was with a network backbone provider, not Spectrum). Once in a while during the wee hours there will be a five minute service interruption (presumably scheduled maintenance). So far I haven’t had an issue that required tech support or service (I probably soon will now that I’ve said that). My only complaint is that Spectrum’s e-mail servers are always painfully slow (one reason I use a separate e-mail provider). Back in the days I was with Verizon their FIOS telemarketers phoned weekly (once when I called for DSL tech support I was “accidentally” routed to a FIOS salesman). They only stopped dunning me after I told them that if I heard from FIOS again I would bundle my telephone and internet business with my cable TV company. About three years later I received a letter from Verizon saying they would soon discontinue their copper wire service and gave me a deadline to adopt FIOS to avoid an interruption in service. The N.Y. State Public Commission told me that “yes, they can do that.” That’s when I made the move to TWC/Spectrum and I haven’t looked back. Another thing about FIOS: If your router/modem dies, don’t expect any help from Verizon. Oh, they’ll try to sell you a new one for $150. But you can buy the same unit for around $100 on Amazon. This is a summary of what I experienced while visiting Mom over the holidays. Ran all over hell’s half acre trying to find her a replacement unit. I finally went to the Big Evil River and ordered one. It arrived two days later, I plugged it in, and the thing worked like a charm. Amr Moussa, Secretary-General of the Arab League before the criminal invasion of Iraq: ‘It will open the gates of hell!’ At that time I found the formulation rather bizzare, theatrical, at the least. Now it seems measured understatement. Agree with Mr. Moussa. I felt similary at the time, despite BushCo jubilantly informing us hapless rubes that the Iraqi’s would greet Team USA! USA! USA! with rose petal parades (I truly think they said something along these lines). Yeah, NO! What a clusterfeck. And how many *millions* marched around the globe against this senseless, greedy, grifting War Crime invasion based on lies, Lies, LIES? And whaddid we get? Over a million dead, and I’m STILL waiting for my Iraqi War Inc Oil “dividend” that W so gleefully “promised” us… with his fingers crossed behind his ratbag back. Pallets of Yankee Dollar$$ shipped “over there” … and who knows what happened with that money? Torture happened, and now we get one of the Chief Torturers as the head of one branch of BigSpook, Inc. Yay, Yay, USA. puke Your tax dollar$ at work. Please don’t bother to “Learn” me about how MY taxes don’t pay for War, Inc. Whatever… they do in some ways. Against an impressive amount of warnings, from a wide variety of sources, including the intelligence community, as to the complexity of the Iraqi situation and the high risks involved in letting loose, imprudently, the long-compressed popular dynamics in that country, the Bush administration chose to listen only to a very specific set of âexpertsâ: the Pentagonâs friends among the Iraqi opposition in exile. The most symptomatic of them in my view is Kanan Makiya-a man who has much been quoted as part of a neocon cabal led by former âTrotskyitesâ that took the helm of U.S. foreign policy, according to a somewhat phantasmagoric view propagated by both liberal and conservative circles. Makiya was recruited at Brandeis University after becoming the anti-Saddam Hussein intellectual par excellence for the media, which-after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990-upgraded to the best-seller list his Republic of Fear, a labored description of Baathist Iraq inspired by both Arthur Koestler and George Orwell. He turned from Trotskyism and friendship with people like Tariq Ali (and myself) into becoming the house intellectual of Ahmad Chalabi, the famous Iraqi crook and Donald Rumsfeldâs buddy. The quote: And when asked if he agreed with the statement made the day before by Vice President Cheney that American forces will be âgreeted as liberatorsâ in Iraq, Makiya replied: âI most certainly do agree with that. As I told the President on January 10th, I think they will be greeted with sweets and flowers in the first months and simply have very, very little doubt that that is the case.â And how could he disagree with Cheney? The latter himself had given Makiyaâs expertise as his key reference in making his prognosis. That was on NBCâs program âMeet the Press.â When Tim Russert, the interviewer, insisted, asking what âif your analysis is not correct, and weâre not treated as liberators, but as conquerors,â Cheney replied: âWell, I donât think itâs likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe that we will be greeted as liberators. Iâve talked with a lot of Iraqis in the last several months myself, had them to the White House. The president and I have met with them, various groups and individuals, people who have devoted their lives from the outside to trying to change things inside Iraq. And like Kanan Makiya whoâs a professor at Brandeis, but an Iraqi, heâs written great books about the subject, knows the country intimately, and is a part of the democratic opposition and resistance. The read we get on the people of Iraq is there is no question but what they want is to get rid of Saddam Hussein and they will welcome as liberators the United States when we come to do that.â “Sweets and flowers” then went viral and became a catchphrase symbolizing the absurd pretensions of the Iraq invasion. * * * Those of us who remember the run-up to the Iraq war — it happened when I was just starting out as a blogger, and gave impetus to what we then called “the blogosphere” — can’t help but be struck by the similarities between that engineered war scare and this one (including the role of the compliant press and the British intelligence agencies, as well as the unanimous approval of war by elites*). The differences are: 1) Bush tried to present and plant actual “evidence” (even if it was shot down) like the yellowcake uranium, the aluminum tubes, and all the rest of it. Today’s effort simply relies on unverified and unverifiable leaks from the intelligence community (along with viral videos). 2) It was clear for a solid year before the shots were fired that Bush was going to war regardless, because there was a massive effort to pre-position the materiel. I don’t see that prepositioning going on now, suggesting that the current crop of warmongers doesn’t want boots on the ground**, but that means drones and air strikes (i.e., not holding ground). How does that work? 3) That the elites want a war, any war, is confirmed by the constant shifts in which foreign power the 5 Minutes of Hate is targeted at. Russia? North Korea? Iran? It doesn’t matter, so long as we get a war with one of them! The Bush administration targeted only Iraq, from the beginning. 4) The United States, as a result of Iraq, may be stronger militarily, but is visibly weaker in every other way (and we haven’t won any wars at all since 1945, have we?) * Most of whom were not held accountable in any way and are still in power (including the torturers). They consider themselves immune, so why wouldn’t they start another war? ** And where would they get them? I’m convinced, FWIW, that the flyover states are tired of this crap, and that’s where the troops come from. Crossed fingers that Sanders is edging toward making an anti-militaristic case to them in terms they can accept, and that his Yemen bill — shot down by Democrats, naturally, since 5 Republicans crossed the aisle to support it — is an opening move. It’s past time to push the political window in the correct direction. (The political science term for the “window” of acceptable discourse has slipped my mind.) For the invasion of Iraq, this entails creatively imagineering appropriate punishments of the kingpins for aggressive war. Germany and Japan had the daylights bombed out of them during the final months of WWII. We really don’t want our metropolitan areas to suffer the same fate. So we probably want more than the ordinary execution that followed the Nuremberg Tribunals. Crucifixion would be ideal if not for the religious symbolism and imagery. But then there’s the rack. And one can web-search other interesting, fetishistic execution methods from Renaissance history. The cost of the war will be paid in blood and guts, not money. Just remember: “War is Hell”. Think of the 12yo son blown up in an aerial bombing, or the 10yo daughter’s left arm and leg blown off. I’ve thought a lot about this, and while I think it’s a useful metaphor, the Overton Window is only two-dimensional. I think political conflict takes place on a plane (a terrain) and not a line (binary thinking). A lot of our stressors come from the effort of forcing multiple dimensions into two. Its all quite curiously low key. I can find very little real detail in the news today, but it seems that the negotiators are quite confident that a deal is almost done on a transition period. The UK has conceded on pretty much every key element so far as I can see. But even the Brexit hardliners seem to be only putting up token resistance. Are they saving up their ammo for later? The DUP have been surprisingly quiet too, are they still trying to take in the implications? I wonder if the hardliners have been persuaded that if they agree to this, then their nirvana has only been delayed by 21 months. I posted a link to the text yesterday, and there was some reasonable quick commentary from experts on the Grauniad and Independent sites. The general consensus was that the UK had given way on almost everything, which seems to be the case from the amount of green in the text. Richard North has a typically cogent analysis this morning, and I think he’s right about the unreality of the whole situation. The muted reactions in the media seem to be a product on the one hand of shock, on the other of an inability to comprehend where we have got to under this government, and on the third, a sense of relief that immediate disaster has been averted, even if the Northern Ireland question remains unsettled, and could sink the whole thing. I think what happened is that the EU put a gun to the government’s head, and said, if you accept basically everything else now, we’ll give you more time to find a political fix for the NI question. May accepted, because it’s a stay of execution and more months, perhaps a year, in power. She’ll sell various communities in NI and Scotland out to do that, without a second thought. Iâll need to reread it several times to make sure Iâve not missed anything but there seems to have been sufficient dollops of eurofudge to keep everyone happy for a couple of years and thereafter in a semipermanent state of muddling through: Article 13 Safeguards 1. If the application of this Protocol leads to serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties liable to persist, the Union or the United Kingdom may unilaterally take appropriate measures. Such safeguard measures shall be restricted with regard to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary in order to remedy the situation. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of this Protocol. 2. If a safeguard measure taken by the Union or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, in accordance with paragraph 1 creates an imbalance between the rights and obligations under this Protocol, the Union or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may take such proportionate rebalancing measures as are strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of this Protocol. Article 15 Subsequent agreement Should a subsequent agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom which addresses the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, avoids a hard border and protects the 1998 Agreement in all its dimensions, become applicable after the entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement, this Protocol shall not apply or shall cease to apply, as the case may be, in whole or in part, from the date of application of such subsequent agreement and in accordance with that agreement. âmeasures as will least disturb the functioning of this protocolâ? What is it, Sleeping Beauty or something? And donât get get me started on the whole of that Article 15. I canât believe they kept straight faces when they issued that doozie. They were channelling Humpty Dumpty with that one: When I use a word,â Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, âit means just what I choose it to meanâneither more nor less.â âThe question is,â said Alice, âwhether you can make words mean so many different things?â I suppose the big question is why? The UK has lots of motivation to fudge like crazy, but the EU doesn’t. I can only assume they’ve decided that the extra time is in everyones short to medium term interest. I agree. It didnât actually hurt the EU anymuch to make the whole Brexit situation more loosely coupled. Theyâve kicked a few cans you could easily stub your toe on quite nastily down the road in the case of a hard Brexit (properly checking imports at major hubs like Europoort Rotterdam and â and Iâll call confess I didnât appreciate the importance of this one â a sudden cliff edge stop for fishing rights) and got the U.K. to pick up the cans it certainly didnât want left lying around (current EU budget round payments and future U.K. obligations to the EIB and pension liabilities). And it acknowledges that the end of 2020 is a long way away, politically. Theresa May will probably be gone, Arlene Foster might not be around so the DUP could wise up (finally…), there might have been a snap UK election, the Commission has got itself into an uncharacteristic tight spot with the bungled Japanese corporate non-governance governance style Ascension to Heaven of Martin Selmayr (which does strongly suggest it has got itself spread too thinly to keep everything on an even keel all at once, especially with big time stealers like Brexit to deal with) and political instability in Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain needing to be handled. Putting Brexit to bed for a year or so just seems in everyoneâs interests right now. And as Brexit is simply not going to go away, this Draft Withdrawal Agreement seems to not displease anyone to a sufficient degree that itâs mostly liveable-with. And the U.K. government also seems to have finally woken up to the fact that itâs about the best they can expect to get. I think, with regard to your last line, is that while the senior negotiators have woken up to the fact that this is the best they can get, they seem to have done precisely zero to ease the way to a climbdown (unless the relative quietness of the hard Brexiters means that they’ve been quietly lobbied and agreed that there will be another time and place for a battle over this). I assume we’ll know when May faces Parliament next – either the Tories will do a big show of solidarity in the face of the Russian hordes, or there will be blood on the carpet. All my other posts today have disappeared into moderation. Perhaps this one will make it through. I think the answer is that the EU wants the most graceful Brexit possible to limit the damage and inconvenience to its members. By accepting so much of the EU draft text, the UK government has effectively committed itself, but also any conceivable future government after an election, to a series of things the EU wants, and been obliged to give up a number of things they were not prepared to accept. You can’t row back from that kind of agreement, even if, technically, nothing is agreed until everything is. If there is a final agreed text, we now have a good idea what it will look like. The NI concession as I have said in another comment earlier, is essentially meaningless. It simply gives more time for realignment of political forces before something like the EU draft text is accepted by the UK. I think it could be, in the sense that Brexit was always primarily a political concept, very vaguely defined, rather than a thought-through economic and political strategy with identified benefits. BINO could actually be sold on this basis, in the sense that, once the UK is out of the EU, the essential political objective will have been met, irrespective of the practical consequences. And I think the rather downbeat reaction to the government’s total surrender this week can only make BINO as an option more likely – all smoke and mirrors in the end, perhaps. They can’t do BINO. The EU has been very clear that any “future relationship” has to fit within existing parameters. The UK’s red lines mean a Canada type deal, and even if they relax them, the best they get is Norway. That is NOT BINO. And if they were to rejoin, they have to accept the Euro. Those are the current rules. You and I know that. I was making a different point, that there is constituency which will be satisfied if the UK is “out” of Europe. They are quite numerous and pay little attention to the detail of negotiations. They are focused on leaving Europe, not on the future relationship, which is a different issue. In other words, it is theoretically feasible for May’s government to claim victory, independently of the content of the withdrawal agreement, on the basis that the UK is now “out” of Europe. The EU’s actions imply that they think they have a lot to lose. I saw one example, which I can’t remember right now. The German automakers might be a factor. And the EU citizens living in the UK are hostages of a sort, especially the ones from places like Poland that aren’t eager to get them back suddenly. But all of that is just speculation. I think analysis of what the EU has to lose has been lacking here, because Yves doesn’t think there’s that much. I’d have to take her word for it, but the EU itself doesn’t. I keep remembering that Britain is one of the Big 5 economies, although not in the Euro. What’s missing from this picture? Is the EU just turning out to be a big softy? Hoping Brexit will be reversed (which I still think likely)? Huh? The UK capitulated on everything that mattered. And we’ve written repeatedly that the German automakers are firmly behind Merkel. The UK press has acted as if the German automakers would rise up and they haven’t. You have to stop believing what you read there. Every European newspaper I read said the UK had caved on all of its red lines. True as that may be, getting the EU to kick the Irish border can of worms further down the road (until the DUP can be soothed or tossed overboard) seems a slight victory for May, but more important was the EU letting the UK negotiate treaties prior to Brexit, which could be a huge opening for the government, if they can get their ducks in a row. May’s job will now be quelling dissent from Brexiteers as the reality sinks in. Rees-Mogg called the agreement unsatisfactory but acceptable, while Farage called for the PM to step down. Yes, that seems the consensus, but the response has been unexpected low key – I think reflecting a lot of puzzlement with what this actually means in reality. I think the big question is whether the government can sell this to the wider Tory party. If there was only some way to distract the populace while all of this was going on. Something that will have all the TV, radio and newspapers all fired up and unified as a nation. Something outrageous that could be turned into a three-ring circus, preferably involving lots of military and their toys but without all the costly messiness of an actual war. Something that would take all the oxygen of the Brexit negotiations/cave-ins. Nope, too much for me. Guess I need to have a brain the size of a planet to come up with something like that. The Verizon cord cutting – sorry to hear. T-Mobile has a plan for unlimited hotspot data plan for their smartphones. “hotspot” creates a wifi you can access with any computer. I think they call it the “international” plan and its a $30 add-on. Totally worth it. Yves I know you hate smartphones but the hotspot data feature is alot faster than DSL. I have the same privacy issues with smartphones as you do if not worse. Get a used samsung version 7 and use it for hotspot and calls only. I dont even have a google acct active on mine, and the location tracking is turned off. One could just as well or better pick up a USB LTE modem aka “air card” for one’s laptop on the order of $30 and get an extra data SIM for it, which was only $10/mo atop my T-Mobile unlimited plan. Bonus: when it’s unplugged, you can be somewhat more sure it’s unplugged. (Of course, if you buy a non-carrier-locked smartphone, hotspot/tethering features are built into recent Android releases and, if you use a VPN atop that, nobody will or can be the wiser.) Yves, I think perhaps he meant you would leave the phone at home. As your internet connection. You are already “located” at your address, by your copper connection. If the phone, or smartcard, stays there with your PC, what is the difference? I don’t understand your point at all. Someone’s home address is known and has pretty much always been public (court records if you own your house, in phone directories unless you paid to be unlisted) even before the Internet. I publish my business phone and address various places. It is a completely different matter to have your phone spying on where you go during the day, all day, with time stamps of where you have been, which is what geolocation does. If you leave your phone home, that does not happen. If you have a smartphone but leave it in a Faraday bag a lot, you cut down the completeness of the record a lot (provided you are not pulling out your phone every two nanoseconds). If you have a dumbphone, they geolocation is less accurate (only to within 100 feet) plus unless you become a target and the authorities get a warrant and track you all the time, your phone company retains data only on when you’ve used the phone, so they can retrospectively locate you only when you were calling or getting/sending texts. And if you have a dumpphone, taking the battery out also stops geolocation. I set up an account (I think, not sure if I finished it) there years ago. May actually have visited once, but ever since, I have been receiving emails from them, even though I haven’t been there for a long time. I don’t even remember my password. So, I am not sure how to delete that account. I would think my account should be inactive, and they would let me alone. Do I have to do something to delete my account? Yes, you absolutely MUST DO something to delete your account, and my understanding is that it is a deliberately complicated process (I don’t know for sure, as I never ever created an account there). There is a way to recover your password (or create a new one), I’m sure. I don’t know how Faceborg does it, but usually there’s a place where you can click on something saying “I forgot my password,” and you enter your email address. They’ll send you a link by email to recreate a new password, so that you can get to your account… in order to delete it. Good luck!! Others who have accounts are likely to be more knowledgeable than me and can chime in with useful pointers. I have deleted my FB account twice in the past three-four years, carefully following the directions both times. However, certain sites will still trigger a request to “log in via Facebook” complete with a view of my page, so I have to conclude that it is still there. Hmmm. I’ve had a facebook account for some time to keep in touch with people who are scattered all over the world, including cousins in the U.S. I haven’t been able to figure out why it’s such a big deal, but I’m an old, so even though I’ve been dealing with computers since 1976 I’m pretty socially inept and probably don’t “get” social networking. I can imagine one of my cousins, a very smart woman with a PhD in Economics, persuading me to change my mind about some point, but I can’t imagine some ugly meme/photo/graphic affecting me in any way but offending. I have a wide assortment of sources which I have assigned appropriate levels of trust on certain topics. I regard almost every announcement by a government official as a lie, also almost all stories in the New York Times and the Washington Post, especially if their sources are “requesting anonymity” for any reason. I happen to think that advertising is generally pretty ineffective, but the advertising agencies have sold themselves as essential to every business. All these “powerful” people are just members of a small in-group doing favors for each other. They provide no value to society, and since Raygun have actually been actively harming society. Another update from the Slim Gives Up Facebook for Lent file: I’m finding that I’m building genuine friendships with people who were acquaintances before March 6. (That was my first full day away from the Borg.) Lent ends on April 1, and the Tucson NC meetup is on April 6. Come to that meetup and I’ll give you a personal update on how the Facebook Fast is going. At this point, I’m planning to keep it going. Because I am having too much fun! People are slowly waking to the fact that their personal data is not worth nothing and can be used against them. Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft, all your phone apps – they should pay you a royalty every time they sell your data (which is often), or at least allow you the option not to release your data. Or better, stop disgorging your life into corporate databases. There is a growing movement designed to persuade people to abandon Facebook and Twitter, playing heavily on privacy concerns and the implication that intelligent people will do it. The problem, as Caity Johnstone and I agree, is that most of the people who need to hear from alternative news sources and commentators aren’t going to switch to some obscure geeky social media option in sufficient numbers to make those alternatives viable for our purposes. Given the constant focus in the corporate media is how stupid people are on the major social media networks because they’re always being persuaded to this and that by Russian trolls, it’s no surprise to me that people who avoid, say, Facebook are totally ignorant of the fact there is a very vibrant community of people who aren’t Clinton cultists with severe cases of Trump derangement syndrome who are working daily to ensure others are aware of alternative narratives. If the people who are most likely to be encouraged to pause and think by those narratives are instead driven off, the narratives have been very effectively muzzled. And the establishment knows it. I’ve said before I do not believe the sudden emergence of social media founders and executives urging people to give up what they founded is an accident. And yes, I have a large roll of aluminum foil handy, but the more I learn the more it becomes clear to me that throwing “conspiracy theorist” at anyone who has qualms about what seems to be a sudden sharp focus on scaring people away from something that can be very useful to rebellion. I doubt that is the case with FaceBook or Twitter, given that all the data collected either already is or wil go to those who want to suppress any rebellion. See Yasha Levine’s Surveillance Valley; the Internet was designed to do just that. Leaving security features out of the basic architecture was not an accident. Dear Yves, I live in Forest Hills, and have Spectrum outages every three months or so. Usually for a day at a time, sometimes shorter, sometimes longer. But regularly I’m told that Time Warner has brought in cheaper labor from outside New York (California often is cited) and workers are sabotaging it. There’s no FIOS out here. My copper land line always works. Time Warner victim, er, customer here. As a coping mechanism, I reboot my system periodically. Our local environment seems to slow down on schedule so that by Thursday that reboot becomes a necessity. Separately, I recommend that everyone continue to be aware of any potential browser updates. These past several days have seen a flurry of activity as companies attempt to address ongoing security and other matters, somewhat beyond the old Patch Tuesdays. The usual caveats apply regarding whether to update and after which version so that you aren’t too much part of an unannounced beta test. Also consider some browser refresh or default restoration options based on your specific user needs. 1800 Spectrum technicians represented by IBEW Local 3 have been out on strike for nearly a year over union security and healthcare issues. These techs worked primarily in Brooklyn and Spectrum has been relying on out of state strikebreakers to maintain their cable network. Great article, and truth be said we’ve only really had ‘play’ earthquakes hit us during our lives-they do a fair bit of damage but nothing really in the scheme of things, and when the last one hit L.A. 24 years ago, the authorities felt the need to pad fatality numbers by including those that had a heart attack and perished right around the same time as the temblor. It feels similar to how one would’ve thought of a tsunami taking out a large amount of people, before the big one hit late in 2004. Just something you never gave any thought to, in terms of what it could do. That said, we’re in a very earthquake safe part of California, where the largest one historically that I could find hitting here was a 4.1, which is the equivalent of a carnival ride, no biggie. I live in one of the first areas that ATT installed with DSL in 1998 (IIRC). Every few years the wires get corroded and the service gets intermittent, but other than that it’s been great, if you think 3 MB/second for $30/month is a deal (we don’t stream TV). I’ve heard from neighbors that our wires won’t be replaced with fiber, that we’re going directly to 5G. Goodbye cheap internet. I have spectrum in queens ny. Internet only package though they are constantly tring to upsell tv stations. We have not had many service outages that we’re not power outages. However, the modem supplied by spectrum does go on the fritz quite often. Just unplug and it usury works, but a tax on time and also very inconvenient when, say, reading naked cap in bed! Formerly TWC, spectrum is just as bad in terms of Custer service Unfortunately it’s my only real choice as Fios is not in my building and RCN amazingly was a bigger crook with worse service than spectrum (ie, slower speeds) I have thought about nyc mesh more than once but find I’m uncomfortable with the tech savvy part I’d have to play I am also in Queens – I have internet only through Spectrum. I don’t often have outages, but I find that I do have to reboot my modem fairly often….sometimes every week. I do have Fios in my building, but when I once called to get pricing…they asked me for my social security number….which I thought was pretty outrageous. I’ve actually been emailing Yves about NYC Mesh (free community owned network once you buy the equipment). Unfortunately she doesn’t have roof access or line of sight from her window to any of the blue or red dots so that’s a no go. Anyone that does have those should totally do it though. Just sign up and they will send someone out to set it up for you if you don’t know how. The refinery bankruptcy seems to be a pretty big deal, because while the company didn’t pay taxes for over two years, it did pay $590 million in dividends. I understand that stiffing vendors to pay dividends is standard for PE firms, but I’ve always thought that taxes were a little different. I’ve seen small businesses and their owners have fines, liens and even jail time for similar activities. âI suspect preliminarily it appears that the Uber would likely not be at fault in this accident …â Moir said. Police also noted that the victim was probably homeless and was also jaywalking. The police haven’t released the video yet, although “From viewing the videos, itâs very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode (autonomous or human-driven) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway,â Moir said. It very well may be that the video shows that this was an unavoidable accident. But the article hints that the video might have been taken by the robot car itself. If so, it raises the question of who is entitled to view the video. I am adjusting my bio detection habits to the quietude of electric vehicles. It was quite unnerving the first time I realized how much I relied my whole life on my sense of hearing to protect me from engine propelled machinery–especially in parking lots and parking garages. Surely some stupid engineer will recommend the fix is electric vehicles will have to go around beep-beep-beeping whenever they are moving forward or backward faster that three miles an hour. Sounds a lot like victim blaming to me, as in she-had-it-coming. And the police saying that she was “probably homeless and was also jaywalking”? WT*? What has that got to do with the lidar not picking her up? Doesn’t lidar work in the dark? I know for a fact that radar does. Does that make her the first crash-test dummy/pedestrian? Apparently, the bicyclist had dangling plastic bags on her handlebars – and was probably homeless. Yes, all the reports I’ve read sound like the victim had it comiing – if you’re homeless, you’re worth nothing in this society. It’s disgusting, and I hope Uber gets sued into kingdom come. âYou can expect that Uber, local regulators, and tech evangelists will make much of the Tempe police report that the woman was outside a crosswalk, although North Mill Avenueâthe eight-lane road the victim was attempting to crossâhas only one crosswalk in nearly two miles of road, making jaywalking a requirement of the urban design.â If the person stepped into the lane of traffic 3 feet or 6 feet in front of the vehicle which was traveling 38 mph how fast how many feet would it take to stop the vehicle once the lidar signaled a warning? In my area there have been lots of incidents where people on bikes at night have been struck by human driven cars. In fact the human drivers around here seem to be ever more careless. Robots might be an improvement. the key point is that the scenario that involved the death of that lady should’ve been 100% baked into the software-hardware on a closed track. Dim lighting + glare + pedestrian on the side of the road + vehicle at high speed there is no excuse for that lady to be dead if the uber car was alpha-beta tested property on a closed track. lady whose life spiraled out of control due to a couple of run-ins with drugs, homeless, killed by the neoliberal-feted future. I’ve met a lot of great drivers, some extremely skilled drivers that are better than me and I have a lot of awards. When we get together the subject of people not getting taught very well always comes up. We’ve been on tracks simulating hazards, difficult maneuvering, wet wide open skid pads to learn chop steering and braking techniques. Things the average driver rarely gets to experience. Here’s one of the greats, whom I agree with a lot, he has a lot of postings besides just this one if someone wishes to take a deep dive. “If our safety was the experts’ first principle, the billions invested in self-driving cars would have gone to subsidizing free professional driving school, raising licensing standards, and making critical safety technologies like seat belts, airbags, ABS and automatic emergency braking (AEB) standard as soon as they were invented.” About trade etc, saw a good one from Timothy Tan Russia is playing chess, China is playing Weiqi and the US is playing checkers But thinks it’s playing chess Thanks for the link. One of the comments there explains what separates the good drivers from not so good and what robots fail at miserably. From Alphastrike . . . The AI cars are a long way off from being able to guess which cars around you are going to be crappy drivers. Type and appearance of car combined with its driving micro mannerisms, and sometimes other details can make a difference. I would like to see robotic controlled vehicles have some type of visible indicator from any direction that it is under robotic control, sort of an AI dunce cap, so they can be easily identified. No doubt different manufacturers will have different characteristics in how they deal with surrounding traffic, unless the government steps in and mandates the same standards for all autonomous vehicles, which doesn’t seem to be what’s happening now. Also mandating that the algorithms used to program the electric and hydraulic systems that control the vehicle be made public seems unlikely even though they are used in public. It’s a free for all and people will get killed and hurt for many years to come. Well there was a “safety driver.” Perhaps that person wasn’t paying proper attention. And as a lifelong cyclist (not so much lately) I’ve long been of the opinion that that expecting cars to respect cyclists’ rights is naive and riders should do everything possible to avoid cars and look to their own safety. Of course that’s not always possible and especially for pedestrians, but the reality is that car drivers are looking out for other cars, not the rarely encountered cyclist or pedestrian. Humans see what they are expecting to see and therefore may have their own “Lidar problem.” Robots will never be better than highly trained, attentive and skilled professional drivers. Electronics are not that reliable in my experience, may not get proper maintenance and will become more unreliable in the years ahead. We are entering a magnetic polar reversal on this planet. That means chaotic magnetic field strength for scores of years into the future. Radiation from our sun does a number on electronic equipment, I’ve experienced it several times. I once bought a new truck and in a month it came to a full stop on a busy two lane road because of a failed engine sensor in a solar storm. Had a street horn start blasting and wouldn’t shut off until I pulled up the hood and disconnected it. The key to success is keep it simple, train drivers well and require refreshment training periodically. Focus on health, proper rest, take breaks to relieve stress and take driving seriously. Driverless vehicles simply aren’t ready to be traveling around with or without human oversight where people can be harmed. That they are anyway is simply proof positive that the whole industry of driverless cars and all the dystopia that goes with it is going to be rammed down our throats with the soft gloves of PR as long as it works, and with raw overwhelming force if not. The legal issues alone would otherwise keep these missiles off public roads for another generation or two. One suggestion, if I may offer it, is that, while those self-driving cars are infallible, humans are not. And, so, to help us very imperfect humans, we put a sign (lit for night time, and must be highly visible) that says, “DRIVEN BY A ROBOT” or something equivalent (BY A NON HUMAN, OR A SUB HUMAN) on each of them . Now, if I was crossing a street, at night, and saw one of them coming, I would be extra careful…so as not to make a mistake. I dunno but seems hard for some wreck of a person to “come from the shadows” (whatever “shadows” even means in the context of an a machine that doesn’t have actual eyes), pushing a bike, so quickly that she gets broadsided. Usain Bolt might have a first step that quick, I suppose. The human driver wasn’t paying attention. So what? Not his/her fault, how can you when nothing happens for long periods of time. And note she/he is highly unlikely to be able to even stop the car as fast as the car could stop itself. We have completely reversed the skill set. Machines are best at insanely fast responses to simple combinations of inputs – something in front of it, stop (and do such a good job of anti-skid braking that those algorithms were made illegal in F1 because they were too much better than the world’s best drivers could accomplish). Humans are good at relatively slow assesment of and adjustment to the world around them. It’s getting dark or snow has started falling or kids play around here or all three so I will adjust my baseline strategy accordingly. I’m certainly not defending Uber, but this area has a lot of odd interchanges between a large freeway, an expressway, major cross town streets, large office parks, multiple regular parks, two bridges, ASU, multiple small venues, pedestrian walkways, etc. It’s also very dark, then very bright, it’s just poorly designed for the multiple traffic situations. Someone posted a link to the street view, but I don’t think the collision took place there. I For $500/year (4G only, $600/yr for 3G/4G), you get a 30Gb/mo, uncapped, on the Sprint network. I’ve had this service since 2015, used it for home/office service several times (2 multi-hour outages this year already, although here in the high desert, equipment failures are more frequent due to environmental factors). While not quite good enough for hi-def video streaming, it’s sufficient for most web-related functions. Since it’s cellular, it’s best to set the modem by a window for best reception. I also use it travelling, it’s much more secure (and sometimes faster) than connecting a laptop to public or hotel/institutional hotspots. Most smart phones can be configured to operate as such a hotspot, but it’s a dedicated function (can’t make/receive calls), and usually requires an additional monthly plan. The Caylix modem service is comparably priced but more flexible to use, and has no cap, so no extra charges for exceeding 30Gb in a month. Thanks but the Sprint network does not work in my apartment. I tried Karma, which runs over the Sprint network. No signal in my apartment. I contact Karma to complain and they say, basically, “Well, our coverage map says it ought to work.” And this was not a device issue. Worked fine at Laguardia, the Dallas and Atlanta airports, and on planes in even more airports (when seated before takeoff). Lambert’s theory is that my building (the first elevator apt. building in NYC) was overbuilt and has so much steel in it that it is partway to being a Faraday cage. Most of the apartment is a dead zone on my 2G phone too. All those tin ceilings are terrible for sending/receiving radio waves. At a B&B in New Brunswick a few years ago I could watch the wifi signal strength on my laptop drop from stout to nothing as I descended the stairs from the lobby at the exact moment when I passed by the tin barrier. Under the lobby was the bar. Luckily, the proprietor was a member of the New Brunswick Scotch Appreciation Society (or some such name) and I soon quit worrying about the interwebs. I was on a backpack trip with a couple of friends 15 years ago, when Shock & AweÂ® rained down upon Iraq, and after the initial skirmishes with boots on the ground went well, it all fell apart quickly. Here on the home front, the housing bubble was accelerating across the country, and by the time the dark days of Fallujah meant that we had to destroy the city in order to save it, the bubble was fully engulfed. Were the 2 episodes interrelated, something gained to pay for the loss of innocents? I thought the Housing Bubble was cooked up as a response to the DotCom collapse. Once, the first was out, they just kept going. Shrub wasn’t exactly popular having just stolen an election. He pushed for a major tax cut, and Greenspan was slashing the Fed rate throughout the year. Yes, he was a new President, but 43 tried to hit the ground running. My sense is many Republicans really believe Gore and company really were “tax and spend” Democrats instead of more polite GOP types. Its overlooked these days, but Bob Woodward revealed Rumsfeld wanted videos of targets for CNN knowing the 2004 election was around the corner. Keeping power was a major issue for the GOP. Imagine if the leading figures of the #Resistance were a fraction of upset at Bush V Gore as they are at the Hillary campaign not understanding the electoral college. Listening to Rep Jim Jordan – R-Ohio on NPR this morning complaining about the extraordinary length of the Mueller investigation “a year already”. aren’t these the same people who supported Ken Starr spending four years investigating the Clintons in the ’90s and four years investigating Benghazi from 2012 to 2106? Mueller has already come up with more indictments and guilty pleas than those 8 years of investigations produced. Facebook seems to have offered various levels of data dissemination with various terms over time – as far as I understand it, these were tightened to a significant degree somewhere in the 2012-2014 period – I had access to secondary services based on facebook (instagram, twitter, etc) in 2014-15 that appeared to have fairly deep access (up-to the ability to run facial recognition based on tagged images in their various databases) Most the services had pretty weak semi ‘AI’ analytics operating on these data sets. I assume these have improved since (at the time I was amazed by how bad the analytics performed generally, although there were some rare and somewhat scary exceptions) I didn’t play with Cambridge Analytica, so can’t comment on their capabilities, but did play with some others that were impressive enough to indicate that CAs claims may be less oversold than some imagine I have jury duty today, and as usual I am hoping to get on an interesting case, hopefully along the lines of somebody using a previously canceled stamp on a letter (a federal offense) or something similarly galling. NeoFeudalism….a great way to keep the troublemakers from traveling to the cities as do tens of millions of Chinese workers. See the “Last Train Home” video on Youtube about the yearly trip back from the factory dormitories to the home villages. These rurals have seen the luxury cars, phones etc, and may want and demand the same back home in the sticks. That’s dangerous. By selectively blocking travel the cities can be more for the golden princelings and wealthy while assuring a lot of rural slaves. I wholeheartedly agree with banning smokers from trains. If we could just ban behavioral thugs from public transit far fewer people would need cars to commute in the U.S. Very interesting account of that mob influencing elections in so many counties. I, for one, would very much like to know who is on their Client List. From the way that this mob were caught out by Channel 4, it seems that it was not only their blackmail victims who were caught with their pants down. I agree– based on those red lines around the eyes. The other possibility might be a scarlet macaw. Wish I could see the other side of the bird and had some idea as to size. But based on this view and those red lines, Iâd go with your call. For years now, i’ve been watching Lake Mead recede from it’s shores, there are boat launching ramps 1/2 a mile from the water in some places. Combine that with Phoenix’s thirst, and it’s a given that the city they cemented over, will be the 1st big American city to go tilt, in my opinion. Foreign observers can have somewhat fanciful notions about the American west. When Piers Taylor of the Netflix series The World’s Most Extraordinary Homes visited a custom house outside Tucson, he made the offhand comment that it never rains in the desert, so the roof doesn’t have to be designed for it. Probably he was there in June, the driest month of the year, not realizing that monsoon rains make August the wettest month (with the corresponding potential for rainwater collection and storage). I have a relative in Bullhead City, AZ. Another HOT spot. His take is that “official” temeratures always are lower than the highs shown by temp monitoring equipment in the private domain. I have been on his shaded patio, when the temps were easily 10deg F. greater than what the NOAA sensors at the airport were broadcasting.(Averraging several thermo measuring devices). Perhaps the PTB has an interest in not scaring off the snowbirds. Yeah, I’m a little foily… Jim – Do you live in Phoenix? Just wondering if it is your position that Phoenix (and other large cities in AZ: e.g. Tucson) does actually have a future? In other words, are you long Phoenix? I visit in-laws in Phoenix a couple of times per year, so just curious. Downtown Phoenix is 1100 ft and sits in a bowl surrounded by mountains which aggravates the smog problem. Regular AZ visitors know about the “snowbirds” who only come in the mild winters and flee the scorching summers. The place is expanding at a terrific clip and only a matter of time before the water runs out (sorry Californians). From the LA Times: Aug 30, 2015 – How a 1930s water war between California and Arizona delayed Parker Dam. “Water war” has for decades been a term used to describe the political battles over water in the West. But back in the 1930s, a fight between California and Arizona over water actually veered from cold war to hot war â almost. I don’t have any trouble believing that Facebook is evil, but a lot of the reaction to the Cambridge Analytica story is a shade too close to Russiagate for my taste. As if “Russia stole the election!” was getting stale, so a new excuse was needed in order to avoid any introspection for Democrats. Now, “Cambridge Analytica stole the election!” Is there really any meat to this story? Even if we don’t dispute that yes, Facebook user data was used by the Trump campaign – would it have actually made any discernible difference in the election? Or a difference more important than, say, Clinton being a terrible candidate, or voter’s dissatisfaction with decades of neoliberalism? So, when will Democratic elites begin to ask: what is the connection between Cambridge Analytica and the British government? I doubt our “special ally” will be subjected to the same intense scrutiny as Russia has. This, despite the fact that Australian, hence British subject, Rupert Murdoch has done inestimably more damage to USA democracy the past four decades than anything Putin and Russia have done. Remember, Britain is a monarchy. Hence, government of, by, and for oligarchs, or “high net worth individuals.” Is it really coincidence that USA has ceased being a republican democracy and become an oligarchy controlled by “high net worth individuals”? “Cambridge Analytica was founded by conservatives Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.” — Wikipedia It is headed by a British former financial analyst and all-round dodgy geezer. He did go to Eton so will know a lot of top Tories. “In 1981, Murdoch bought The Times, his first British broadsheet, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen (and as a result, gave up Australian citizenship) in 1985 to satisfy the legal requirement for U.S. television ownership.” — Wikipedia You are right about the damage he has done, in the UK and Australia not just the US. You are a bit confused about the British and Australian political setup. On Facebook and Cambridge Analytica let’s not fall into the trap that this was a Trump show exclusively. In fact Carol Davidsen who was the former head of the Obama 2012 analytics efforts just revealed yesterday in a series of tweets that they extracted by devious means the complete social graph of the US population from Facebook databases and as she says: “Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didnât stop us once they realized that was what we were doing.” I doubt that Obama did not share the (updated?) social graph data with Hillary so what I don’t understand is the 2016 unsuccessful(?) effort by the Hillary campaign to get the Bernie mailing list even though Hillary had Google and Facebook in her back pocket (remember Eric Schmidt at the Hillary ‘Victory’ party in NYC). I was also thinking that one thing that is under the radar is the USPS database since for years now all mail covers are scanned so the Bernie mailing list can be reverse engineered from their database. Actually the USPS has recently taken advantage of the ‘service’ to make it available to residents who are absent and need to be notified by email of regular mail being delivered to their registered address. I use the service myself since I am away from home for long periods and need to know if something unexpected shows up. There are probably laws that prevent its use in that way but who knows… A couple of disquieting parallels to the Internet Bubble which ended 18 years ago: 1. At 75%, the portion of IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) with negative earnings is at the highest level since 1999. One is reminded of a 1999 commercial in which two tech bros are talking stocks. “I was gonna take a flyer on Jetson Datatech, but it’s got earnings.” “Dude … bummer!” 2. On Jan 14, 2000 — in the same month Robert Shiller’s Irrational Exuberance was published — the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its cyclical peak of 11,723. A couple of months later, the poster child of the Internet Bubble, the high-flying Nasdaq Composite which contained many of those no-earnings IPOs, reached its final Bubble I summit of 5,048. In an echo of that pattern, this year the Dow’s last record high of 26,617 was reached on Jan 26th. Last week on March 12th, the Nasdaq rose to a record high of 7,588, three percent above its March 2000 high water mark after inflation adjustment. Ideally, a strong bull market exhibits across the board strength in all sizes and sectors of stocks. When strength in one index is not confirmed by another, it suggests narrow, fluctuating leadership and diminishing momentum. Now a lethal cocktail of reckless fiscal policy, a pending trade war, and a potential Watergate-replay constitutional crisis may finally have inserted the decisive poisoned banderilla into the neck of our beloved Bubble III, which is all that keeps America’s decaying Potemkin economy in the semblance of a recovery. Being a geezer from The Horizon, I worry that this Bubble Popping Ceremony will mimic what happened after the 1929 market breaks. We already have a cheap reproduction Herbert Hoover at the helm of the Ship of State. I can almost write in my head the press releases announcing cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and federal matching funds for everything not MIC related in order to “keep the budget balanced in these hard times.” Our esteemed Fed picadors will have laughingly noticed that many of the vicariously valued viewers of this machismo sport were struck by the deflationary darts. We paid to see this show! Who do we importune to get our money back? Some suspect that the ‘money’ was never ‘there’ to begin with. From where I sit, near the bottom of the cheap seats, this Potemkin Village is in just a ‘shamblance’ of a recovery. Bring on the Bears! Re internet connection — I had FIOS for about a year in NYC and vaguely recall an outage or two but more significantly I found the connection to be subject to frequent hiccups that would interrupt streaming (even of audio-only sources). It was irritating enough that I switched to Spectrum which has not had such problems. By the way, the FIOS box, which was in the apartment when I moved in, is quite a large eyesore growing out of the wall. Your experience with DSL sounds better than mine during a stint in the upstate wilds; I was close to the phone company office but the connection was still unreliable. RE: the SacBee article re CalPers retirees being worried about their pensions, one of the commenters to the artilcle links to yesterday’s NC article (also linked above) about the perfidious behavior of the CalPers Board turning off new Board Member, Margaret Brown’s mic and refusing to provide her with past info. Couldn’t happen to a nicer bloke. Sarkozy was right at the forefront of leading France into the destruction of Libya and he should be in a slammer at the Hague. Still, people like this are never brought to account for their war crimes so if he is in deep doo-doo, it must be for other reasons. Maybe Macron wants to remove him as a political threat down the track? Time will tell as stuff like this comes out eventually. I had forgotten he was President of France then. What I remember is when he was leaving the IMF and was in New York for some reason, he was accused of raping a maid at his hotel. There was some confusion in her story and she had an unsavory boyfriend, and of course he’s rich, so the prosecutor decided to drop the case, but Sarkozy made a number of arrogant statements that convinced me he was guilty, and several stories emerged that suggested he had almost certainly done the same think in several other hotels around the world. I must say I’m enjoying the schadenfreude. Funny that all this is coming up for you just at this moment, Yves. I had Time-Warner cable for about 10 years at my old apartment in Jackson Heights, Queens. They would have occasional service outages, mostly related to the wires out on the street, which were highly prone to storm damage. But I found they were quite diligent with customer service and it was never a big problem. Until they were bought out by “Spectrum”, and then all went to hell. Spectrum forced me to “upgrade” the modem we leased from them (they said it was out of date), and from then on connectivity was a constant on-off, worked-okay-until-it-didn’t kind of thing. Quite literally, my connection was broken every 2 minutes, forcing me to open my network preferences and run the diagnostic cycle. Nine times out of ten, this resumed the connection, but it was seriously annoying. I assumed (silly me) that it was just the new modem, so I called them up and told them to send me a replacement, which they did. It worked no better than the so-called “upgrade”, which convinced me that Spectrum was, in fact, throttling my service since I was purchasing an internet-only package at the lowest rate. When we moved to Forest Hills in the fall, the same problems continued. I was already turned off by Spectrum’s abuse of its labor force and its poor relationship with its labor unions, and we resolved to switch services. We finally ditched Spectrum about 3 weeks ago. On the “severance call”, I told them I was leaving because of the precipitous decline in service, their abhorrent customer service (every time you call you’re forced through a long series of automated responses, and then told that if you pay a bill with a live operator they’ll charge you an additional $4.95 or something), and because of the company’s mistreatment of its labor force. Spectrum, in turn, completely messed up our final billing (sending payments made on the new account to the old, and vice-versa), and despite cancelling our service back in February, they just sent us a *new* bill, with a past-due date for the previous month (which we had already paid). It took a 37-minute phone call last week straighten that out, and I won’t be convinced that all’s fixed until the actual final bill arrives. As for Verizon and service outages: a week after we had FIOS installed, we lost service and reported it to the company…they sent a tech out and within 3 hours they had rectified the situation (they said it was a bad splice on the fiber cable outside our apartment). That was an inconvenience, but I felt they handled it well. After the March 7 storm, FIOS was down again. The symptoms looked the same, but this time when I called, the earliest they could get a tech out to us was 48 hours later (the morning of Sunday the 11th). The appointment time came and went, we made several calls to Verizon (diverted to their answering service, which seems to be located in India) but could get no clear answer on what was happening. Finally, on one call the operator told us that the damage was on the street âÂ due to the storm â and that a construction crew had been sent out to do repairs. These were finally effected around 8PM that day, and we got a text message telling us service had been restored. Since then our service has been fine. Can’t say I’m happy with Verizon, and in particular the fact that if you call them for service outages on a weekend, you get sent to a call center thousands of miles and several time zones away. But we *had* to switch, as Spectrum had become intolerable, and in this new area we didn’t seem to have much other choice. I wish New York City had good-quality municipal broadband. You would think there might be a market for such a product here. This would make for the ultimate disaster film other than a meteor strike, ET alien invasion or full scale nuclear war. Although this is only part one & covers only Portland, I imagine more substantial damage. Not only would an earthquake of this magnitude or greater severely impact buildings & infrastructure, but imagine that it sets off all of the Cascade volcanoes from Northern California to Northern Washington state. Now you have ash that prevents air traffic, including helicopter assistance with emergency relief. There may be pyroclastic mud flows driving Westward toward the large cities. A tsunami may be heading Eastward toward some of the big cities. Now you have pincer movement of mud flows from one side and a tsunami from the other side. Yikes !! If you’re a fan of avoiding long-tail risks and live in earthquake country, no excuse to not have a simple disaster kit: first aid-tourniquet supplies, batteries, flashlight, water, a decent amount of gas in the car, etc. If-when the big one comes, people likely be on their own for hours as the emergency services will be too busy dealing with fires and extricating people from collapsed masonry buildings. Hours. Hah! After Katrina, our neighborhood was “on its’ own” for a week. If this exercise in Disaster writing did its’ research right, expect ‘Gilligans’ Island’ conditions to last a half year or longer. They did on the Gulf Coast in 2005. That assumes a functioning economy in the rest of the nation however. When Cascadia goes, how much of the national infrastructure goes with it? If Seattle goes dark, how much of the Internet goes dark with it? Etc. We have friends and family at the coast. The coast range highways are unstable in the best of times. I think that after a magnitude 9 and tsunami, the coast will be partly isolated INDEFINITELY. Aid will come only from the sea, and maybe the air. And not from the valley, anyway, which will be in the shape Rothstein describes. Fortunately, Oregon has no large cities exposed to tsunamis, but a legion of smaller settlements. Friends of ours live just within the tsunami zone, and he’s too old to move quickly uphill. Newport, mentioned in the article, would be hit but most of it is elevated (the touristy waterfront would be wiped out, and the bridges would go down). Astoria is also hilly, but the waterfront would be flooded. Seaside is the worst: it’s cut off from higher ground by a river with only a few bridges across it. A tsunami would wash completely over it. I wouldn’t live there in any circumstances. Give a thought to Port Angeles, on the north coast of the Olympic Peninsula, and Victoria, which is the provincial capital of British Columbia, if a magnitude-9 quake triggered a tsunami. Think of that sucker coming into the Straits of Juan de Fuca, which would narrow it and thus raise it. Port Angeles and Victoria are both at sea level. My heart doesn’t bleed for Victoria since it, a provincial capital (!), is still dumping its raw sewage into the Straits last I heard. Regarding the MOA story, click through to the Craig Murray site and read some of the stuff there. I canât avoid the feeling this is a Tory effort aimed at Jeremy Corbyn. Russia is the new cannon aimed at the left. Having switched from Spectrum to FIOS in Manhattan a few months ago – based on my experience, Spectrum has more down time and happens more often. When working normally, connection speed seems to be about the same. Navigating the TV is easier on Spectrum however. I understand that Genghis Khan either allowed local tribal chiefs to ride and conquer with him or executed them based on their ability to solve a similar puzzle. They were given a stick and allowed to work the problem out in the dirt of a hut in which they were imprisoned. The objects were balls of dissimilar weight and you were allowed three moves to find the odd one. I cannot remember any more details than this. I lost the written solution years ago. Anyone remember it? Preliminary preparations for the New START treaty which the Russian media outlet TASS sees as encouraging. While our burgeoning stratocracy states it’s support for the Iran deal to the warmongers in Congress. That picture of the Skripals in the Moon of Alabama post: see the dispenser bottle in the foreground? Looks like they’re sitting at the bar, and the barkeep took the picture – part of his job. Or it could have been any random stranger. Much ado about nothing. I don’t think so here. It looks like that they are sitting on chairs set against the back of the place as shown by the mirror reflection on the right. If you look between your heads, you can see the bloke actually taking the photo which looks like an actual camera rather than a mobile. By now Wiltshire detectives would have interviewed and gotten witness statements from all the staff and everybody that was in that place that day but I have not heard some bloke putting his hand up and saying that it was he that took that photo. Re whistleblowers and striking back: Medicare and Medicaid programs get defrauded from all angles by all kinds of scams. A big one is pharmaceutical fraud, by Big Pharma. A little tiny pharmacy that started out in Key West, providing infusion meds to people with HIV, discovered one such scam, and its owners got together with a local âbulldogâ attorney to bring a âqui tamâ lawsuit naming the company. Qui tam is an action by a citizen âon behalf or relation ofâ a government, essential to embarrass and thus force the government to take action for violations of law that said government should be investigating and enforcing through government mechanisms. Hereâs a pop version of âHow Four Men Got Rich Exposing Pharma Fraud,â https://www.cnbc.com/id/41491563. There is a lot more about Ven-a-Care if one cares to search on their name â they have recovered or catalyzed the recovery of billions in fraudulent claims for federal and state governments, and for what itâs worth, not much in our mindless age, have highlighted a lot of very bad behaviors. They are still at it. Hereâs a link detailing qui tam law, and offering information on how to whistleblow by bringing such actions, and do it with less risk of ânegative consequencesâ from either the government or the private interests who are involved in the scams: https://www.phillipsandcohen.com/what-is-a-qui-tam-case/ Note that as with the case flagged in this post, many states have false claim act statutes, not just the feds. Though I understand that ALEC and other Interested Parties are busily lobbying to un-legislate all of them, as a âdr u ag on the market.â https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0612353/ Iâve always wondered why there have been no or very few qui tam actions in relation to the whole FIRE scam, and of course the whole MICC scam. Maybe they play a harder game of ball than Pfizer and their ilk… but for all you risk-takers, think of the potential payday! Ven-a-care principals are now multi-millionaires, all for doing well by doing good… NB: I have no connection whatsoever (except possibly as one of the defrauded, or as a âcustomerâ who was prescribed meds made by one of the scammers, or as an unfortunate citizen living under a regime that is might one say boughtandpaidfor) to any of the several entities highlighted in this comment I read “5 minutes”, about the effect of a Cascadia Subduction quake on Portland – from a quake off Newport. We live just 50 miles, as the crow flies, inland from Newport. I’m not the only Oregon commenter; most of us will be dreaming about that article tonight, if we read it. Our soil is clay and would liquefy if wet, as it is now and probably would be in April. Our trees fall over on a regular basis. We’re between two rivers, the Willamette and a small tributary. We have friends at the coast, family in Portland and Astoria – which is built on hills and slides even without a quake. Maybe I shouldn’t have read that. Re: China’s social credit system, stories like this make me almost wish for American hegemony to stay in place forever just so we can avoid Chinese hegemony. Even though I have praised some aspects of the Chinese system (like the “iron rice bowl’ state sector jobs that have already declined in number) they are outweighed by the authoritarianism and conformity that seems to run through much of Chinese society. The Chinese experiment disproves “end of history” narratives that economic development will inevitably produce freedom and democracy. The sad thing is that the United States already has something close to a de facto social credit system. Not only your credit score but your social media presence, work history, criminal record and even the kind of people you hang out with and your tastes in leisure activities are now grounds for denial of employment and social ostracism. For all of our purported tolerance and social liberalism 21st-century Americans strike me as more judgmental, uptight, conformist and status-conscious than Americans in the later 20th century. It is now OK to be openly gay but just make sure that you aren’t poor, have perfect teeth and work in a a handful of “respectable” professions. Please no “burger flippers.” Not that I’m foily, but reading not even between the lines but explicitly stated in the Cambridge Analytica / Facebook story, is that CA’s parent company, SCL Group is a privately held (no doubt for reasons of deniability) division of British intelligence. So maybe we don’t need to worry so much about “Russian interference” in our elections as MI6’s? “Tamsin Shaw, a philosophy professor at New York University, and the author of a recent New York Review of Books article on cyberwar and the Silicon Valley economy, told me that sheâd pointed to the possibility of private contractors obtaining cyberweapons that had at least been in part funded by US defence. She calls Wylieâs disclosures âwildâ and points out that âthe whole Facebook projectâ has only been allowed to become as vast and powerful as it has because of the US national security establishment. âItâs a form of very deep but soft power thatâs been seen as an asset for the US. Russia has been so explicit about this, paying for the ads in roubles and so on. Itâs making this point, isnât it? That Silicon Valley is a US national security asset that theyâve turned on itself.â No, I don’t think Nina goes easy on the Ds. But institutionally/structurally the Ds are players in the warmongering, even drivers, so they need to be part of the story. This was all coming, IMNSHO, the day The Blob forced Trump to defenestrate Flynn. Your problems with internet service reminded me of a decade long hobby horse of mine: why do we have credit unions for finance but nobody has yet invented the communications union for cellular/internet access? Iâd join the first one that offered service here in tech friendly central tx ml article suggests ml suffers from issues including insufficient and inconsistent documentation. these are issues i associate with early tools and craft. it’s as much a science as industry and without an industry standard mass production’s not gonna happen no matter how good individual machines are. A new low has been reached with the Gina Haspell defenders. As if it’s not bad enough to pull the “just following orders” bit from the wastpaper bin of Nuremburg they’ve taken it to another level by using it not to claim torturers and war criminals shouldn’t be executed or locked away for life but that they shouldn’t even have the steady upwards progress of their careers impeded!

Facebook has said there is \"no place for hate speech\" on its platform. \"We take this incredibly seriously and have worked with experts in Myanmar for several years to develop safety resources and counter-speech campaigns,\" a Facebook spokeswoman told the BBC. \"This work includes a dedicated Safety Page for Myanmar, a locally illustrated version of our Community Standards, and regular training sessions for civil society and local community groups across the country. \"Of course, there is always more we can do and we will continue to work with local experts to help keep our community safe.\" 'Incitement to violence' The UN's Fact-finding Mission on Myanmar announced the interim findings of its investigation on Monday. During a press conference the chairman of the mission, Marzuki Darusman, said that social media had \"substantively contributed to the level of acrimony\" amongst the wider public, against Rohingya Muslims. \"Hate speech is certainly, of course, a part of that,\" he added. \"As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook and Facebook is social media.\" A colleague acknowledged that the service had helped people in the country communicate with each other.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. LONDON â The U.K.âs information and data privacy regulator is investigating whether Facebook responded ârobustlyâ to reports that political data firm Cambridge Analytica gained access to data on 50 million of its users. âWe are looking at whether or not Facebook secured and safeguarded personal information on the platform and whether when they found out about the loss of the data, whether they acted robustly and whether or not people were informed,â Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham told the BBC on Tuesday morning. Denham first demanded access to the data held by Cambridge Analytica on March 7, the Information Commissioner's Office said in a statement. The company didn't respond by the deadline given and on Monday evening Denham announced that the ICO is seeking a warrant for the information. She did not say when regulators had started looking into Facebook. Later on Tuesday, Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that it has offered to share the information requested by the regulator, and that it will open its offices to officials â subject to an agreement on the scope of the inspection. Facebook had started its own audit at Cambridge Analytica's London office, but halted it at the request of the regulator, the company said Monday. The ICO said that Facebook's search \"would potentially compromise a regulatory investigation.\" The British government has called the allegations âvery concerning.â \"It is essential that people can have confidence that their personal data will be protected and used in an appropriate way,\" a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday. On Tuesday, a senior British lawmaker requested that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg appear before Parliament's media committee in relation to the reports. \"It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,\" Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said in a letter addressed to Zuckerberg. \"I hope this representative will be you.\" Collins earlier alleged that Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Alexander Nix had \"deliberately misled\" his committee during testimony about its use of Facebook data. It's time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other CEOs to testify before Congress. The American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election. In the U.S., both Democrats and Republicans issued strong statements calling on Facebook to make changes and questioning whether the company had grown too big, too fast. Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted on Tuesday that it was \"time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other CEOs to testify before Congress.\" On Monday, NBC Newsâ U.K. partner ITN Channel 4 News broadcast a meeting captured on hidden camera between the head of Cambridge Analytica and their reporters posing as potential clients interested in changing the outcome of the Sri Lankan elections. The reporters, who were trying to find out how the company operated, learned about the novel and deceptive methods employed by the company, including bribes, blackmail, and misinformation campaigns. They recorded Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, discussing the idea of hypothetically entrapping an opposition leader. He described how the company could record a person accepting a bribe, \"an offer he can't refuse\" or \"send some girls around to the candidateâs house.\" Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Dating from the early years of this century, when Facebook had just 4,000 users, the conversation was highlighted this week in a Medium post by Maria Bustillos entitled ‘The Smallness of Mark Zuckerberg.’ It’s from messaging records dating from when Mark Zuckerberg was 19, and was first leaked to the media in 2010. Zuckerberg: Yea so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard, just ask. ‘i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, sms Facebook shares all your ‘Likes’ by default – along with a lot of other information, such as where you live and (if you opt in) where you go. Mark Zuckerberg made a New Year’s Resolution to address Facebook’s problems this year. In a Facebook post, he said, ‘Facebook has a lot of work to do – whether it’s protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent. ‘We won’t prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools.’ EDITORS NOTE: Funny how few people realize that Social Media are advertising and data gathering platforms. I don't use facebook anymore, closed my account 2 years ago. Got so sick of people sharing pics of their dinner before they ate it. And people saying oh it looks lovely. When it clearly looked like something you wouldn't feed your dog. Everything about facebook is so fake, including most of the people on it. Comments Post a Comment Popular posts from this blog Hello, for those of you unfamiliar with my writing let me start off by saying that I am not a writer so please bear with me. I also did not become a writer to hear myself piss and moan. I am here to recruit you to become the change that you desire. But now I'm getting ahead of myself. First I need to show you the extent of how corrupt our system is with impeccable sources, right? This corruption applies to both of America's political parties. I will show you how it does not matter which party holds office or which political party you vote for, because corrupt corporate America controls both the republicans and the democrats making voting a farce. Our local police force is a very good example of our entire corrupt system because it is the most visible and the easiest to understand. Their motto is to protect and serve but they fall short of that, to put it politely. Would we the people allow and support a police force that was repeatedly guilty of raping … This is a short history of the Underground. In light of today's political climate an underground is more important than ever. But first, what is the Underground? The underground is not right wing or left wing, black or white, in the 1800's the Underground railroad helped to free the slaves, in 1940's Germany the Underground worked to free the Jews. And yet the Underground has no religion. Freedom is believed to be God given because we are not born into bondage or debt. The Underground sees everyone, black, white, Christian or Jew as sons of the same God. The Underground fights for everyone's freedom. And can not stop until everyone is free. Here is a very brief history of the Underground: I was debating on a title for this article when I looked up Google's top searches and it says that I should name this article either Facebookly or Youtubie because that is really all that you ever search for. Which makes me wonder how you will ever learn anything if you only search what you already know? EDITORS NOTE: The sources I use for every claim made in this article can be found at the bottom of this article. On the other hand, how could you possibly search for what you have never heard of before? But I decided against calling this Facebookly or Youtubie because those names suck. Let's be honest with ourselves, I've lived in this country for all of my life and I have never, not once been protected or served, have you? I've been robbed. I've been shot at.

Best known for assisting the 2016 presidential campaign of US President Donald Trump, Cambridge Analytica is now facing a government search of its London office, questions from US state authorities, and a demand by Facebook that it submit to a forensic audit. How Did the Company Start? Cambridge Analytica is an offshoot of Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) Group, a government and military contractor that says it works on everything from food security research to counter-narcotics to political campaigns. SCL was founded more than 25 years ago, according to its website. Cambridge Analytica was created around 2013 initially with a focus on US elections, with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, The New York Times reported. The company, which The New York Times reported was staffed by mostly British workers then, assisted Republican Senator Ted Cruz's presidential campaign before helping Trump's. What Does It Do? Cambridge Analytica markets itself as providing consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients. It does not list its corporate clients but on its website describes them as including a daily newspaper that wanted to know more about its subscribers, a women's clothing brand that sought research on its customers and a US auto insurer interested in marketing itself. Britain's Channel 4 News reported on Monday, based on a secretly recorded video, that Cambridge Analytica secretly stage-managed Kenya President Uhuru Kenyatta's campaigns in the hotly contested 2013 and 2017 elections. Cambridge Analytica denied the report. The company's website lists five office locations in New York, Washington, London, Brazil and Malaysia. When Did It First Get Attention? After Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, The Times reported last year. The company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters, which was a \"secret sauce\" it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could. Rival consultants and campaign aides, though, expressed doubts about the company's claims. Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital operations in 2016, said the campaign did not use Cambridge Analytica's data, relying instead on voter data from a Republican National Committee operation. What is It Accused Of? Cambridge Analytica, beginning in 2014, obtained data on 50 million Facebook users via means that deceived both the users and Facebook, The New York Times and London's Observer reported on Saturday. The data was harvested by an application developed by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, the newspapers said. Some 270,000 people downloaded the application and logged in with their Facebook credentials, according to Facebook. The application gathered their data and data about their friends, and then Kogan passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, according to both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it did not initially know Kogan violated Facebook's terms, and that it deleted the data once it found out in 2015. Kogan could not be reached for comment. The data, though, was not deleted, the two newspapers reported on Saturday. CambridgeAnalytica said that the allegation was not true. Facebook said it was investigating to verify the accuracy of the claim. What Happens Next? Facebook said it was pressing Cambridge Analytica for answers, after getting assurances from the firm in 2015 that it had deleted all data. Facebook has hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to help. While Facebook investigates, the social network said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica, its parent SCL, Kogan and another man, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, from its platform for violating Facebook rules. Facebook's probe, though, may have to wait until government authorities complete their investigation. The UK Information Commissioner's Office is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's office and asked Facebook's auditors to stand down in the meantime, according to Facebook. Attorneys generals from the US states of Massachusetts and Connecticut have launched investigations into how the Facebook data was handled, and the attorney general's office in California, where Facebook is based, said it had concerns.

Company stock plunges. | National | wcfcourier.com","text":"NEW YORK â The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook's privacy practices following a week of privacy scandals including allegations a Trump-affiliated political consulting firm got data inappropriately from millions of Facebook users. Facebook's stock, which already took a big hit last week, plunged as a result. Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the probe would include whether the company engaged in \"unfair acts\" that cause \"substantial injury\" to consumers. Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after revelations that Cambridge Analytica got data on Facebook users, including information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing. Facebook is also facing questions over reports that it collected had years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths and information about text messages from Android users. Facebook said in a statement on Monday that the company remains \"strongly committed\" to protecting people's information and that it welcomes the opportunity to answer the FTC's questions. News outlets reported on the FTC investigation last week, but the FTC hadn't confirmed it until Monday. Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances. Facebook said Sunday that this information is uploaded to secure servers and comes only from people who gave explicit consent to allow it. Officials say the data is not sold or shared with users' friends or outside apps. They say the data is used \"to improve people's experience across Facebook\" by helping to connect with others. But the company did not spell out exactly what it used the data for or why it needed it. Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, believes Facebook was in violation of the 2011 settlement in letting Cambridge Analytica harvest data on friends of Facebook users. \"This is what Facebook was doing 10 years ago that people objected to, what the FTC should have stopped in 2011,\" Rotenberg said. \"It makes zero sense that when a person downloads their apps, they have the ability to transfer the data of their friends.\" Subscribe to Breaking News * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.indiatides.com/user-data-leaks-at-facebook-pull-tech-further-into-political-debate/","title":"User data leaks at Facebook pull tech further into political debate - India Tides","text":"Cambridge Analytica had worked withÃÂ University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, who had developed an app called Ã¢â¬ÅthisisyourdigitallifeÃ¢â¬Â and obtained user information Ã¢â¬â which theÃÂ Times is reporting scooped up information on profiles of as many as 50 million users.ÃÂ Late Friday, Facebook acknowledged that 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted access to usersÃ¢â¬â¢ geographic information. But just one person Ã¢â¬â with hundreds of friends Ã¢â¬â allowing access to a personal information through an app, circa 2014, may have had a much larger impact than it does today. In the earlier stages of a company, itÃ¢â¬â¢s possible that policies are not rigorous enough and the guardrails on various APIs are not robust enough that this kind of information can just get out in the open without additional scrutiny, allowing firms to take advantage of those shortcomings. Facebook executives, on Twitter no less, were quick to be clear that this wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t a breach Ã¢â¬â though the argument is that it is, indeed, might not be considered a breach in the traditional sense of the word. But, hereÃ¢â¬â¢s what Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos said: Update:ÃÂ Stamos deleted his Tweets. The above is a screenshot of his previous tweet. HereÃ¢â¬â¢s his explanation. I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in. I’m going to step away from this one. I really care about privacy and security, as well as platform openness, freedom from censorship and stopping authoritarians who use the internet as a weapon. I just wish I was better about talking about these things in the reality of 2018. Prior to deleting his tweets, Stamos posted a long thread that explained the nitty gritty of the situation, which is that around the time of the quiz, the Facebook API allowed developers to see a much wider swath of the data thatÃ¢â¬â¢s available now. Those APIs were updated in 2015 to remove the ability to see that kind of friend data, a move Stamos said was Ã¢â¬ÅcontroversialÃ¢â¬Â with app developers at the time. These policies in reality are constantly evolving and trying to hit a moving target, especially at the scale of Facebook with more than 2 billion monthly active users. That being said, TrumpÃ¢â¬â¢s margin of victory in terms of the final vote counts in pivotal states was narrow, so information on theÃÂ right 50 million people could have made a huge difference. While Facebook was a publicly-traded company, with a fiduciary duty to its shareholders in 2014 to not have massive screwupsÃÂ and probably a lot more responsibility to keep this kind of information in check, itÃ¢â¬â¢s hardly alone in that respect. WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve seen instances of those missing guardrails to access in many companies and used in many inappropriate ways, like UberÃ¢â¬â¢s Ã¢â¬Ågod viewÃ¢â¬Â and LyftÃ¢â¬â¢s own troubles. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s definitely a different situation, but when a company is in growth mode, these kinds of guardrails might simply not be a high priority. That might be especially true when the data sets become increasingly large and simply managing them becomes a huge technical effort.ÃÂ Facebook had 1.39 billion monthly active users by the end of Q4 2014. To be sure, It doesÃÂ not make the scale of this incident any less severe or important. Facebook came out with a statement late Friday that it had suspended the account ofÃÂ Strategic Communication Laboratories and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica. However it appears it still may have again downplayed the total scale of the data Kogan had acquired from Facebook users. The Times said it downplayed the scope of the leak and Ã¢â¬Åquestioned whether any data still remained out of its controlsÃ¢â¬Â throughout a week of inquiries. This was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked. We reached out to Facebook for some additional information, and will update when we hear back. But for the time being Facebook executives seem to continue to follow a trend of explaining themselves on Twitter, so weÃ¢â¬â¢ll take that as the current statement for Facebook. Facebook announced late Friday that it had suspended the account of Strategic Communication Laboratories, and its political data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica Ã¢â¬â which used Facebook data to target voters for President Donald TrumpÃ¢â¬â¢s campaign in the 2016 election. In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the companyÃ¢â¬â¢s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to Ã¢â¬Åthe public prominence of this organization.Ã¢â¬Â Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called Ã¢â¬ÅthisisyourdigitallifeÃ¢â¬Â that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of Ã¢â¬Åa research app used by psychologists.Ã¢â¬Â Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to usersÃ¢â¬â¢ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about usersÃ¢â¬â¢ friends. While KoganÃ¢â¬â¢s method of obtaining personal information aligned with FacebookÃ¢â¬â¢s policies, Ã¢â¬Åhe did not subsequently abide by our rules,Ã¢â¬Â Grewal stated in the Facebook post. Ã¢â¬ÅBy passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.Ã¢â¬Â Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action Ã¢â¬â apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information. Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie. Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica eitherÃÂ played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential electionÃÂ or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge AnalyticaÃ¢â¬â¢s so-called secret sauce as Ã¢â¬ÅexaggeratedÃ¢â¬Â in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge AnalyticaÃ¢â¬â¢s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted WikileaksÃ¢â¬â¢ Julian Assange with an offer to helpÃÂ disseminate Hillary ClintonÃ¢â¬â¢s controversial missing emails. In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign). Ã¢â¬Â¦We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to TrumpÃ¢â¬â¢s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didnÃ¢â¬â¢t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (itÃ¢â¬â¢s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as IÃ¢â¬â¢ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly thereÃ¢â¬â¢s psychographic data thatÃ¢â¬â¢s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because weÃ¢â¬â¢re not reinventing the wheel. [WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and weÃ¢â¬â¢ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didnÃ¢â¬â¢t have time. We just couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t do that. The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015. The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of FacebookÃ¢â¬â¢s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform. Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadnÃ¢â¬â¢t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena. Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬â¢s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,Ã¢â¬Â Nix told TechCrunch last year. Ã¢â¬ÅÃ¢â¬Â¦There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which weÃ¢â¬â¢re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.Ã¢â¬Â Responding to the allegations, Cambridge Analytica sent the following statement. In 2014, SCL Elections contracted Dr. Kogan via his company Global Science Research (GSR) to undertake a large scale research project in the US. GSR was contractually committed to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR were also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. The language in the SCL Elections contract with GSR is explicit on these points. GSR subsequently obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with FacebookÃ¢â¬â¢s terms of service, SCL Elections deleted all data it had received from GSR. For the avoidance of doubt, no data from GSR was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election. Under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act (Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data), a criminal offense has not been committed if a person has acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain data. GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections illegally acquired Facebook data. Indeed SCL Elections worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that SCL Elections had not knowingly breached any of FacebookÃ¢â¬â¢s Terms of Service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted. Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data. A few weeks ago I met with, and interviewed, Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica. His company has been credited with helping Donald Trump win the U.S. presidency. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s also been associated with many other controversial political campaigns globally and accused by some of aiding the U.K.Ã¢â¬â¢s exit from the EU. He addresses all of these subjects in detail (a shorter summary is here). The interview, which was recorded, was conducted in private at the IT Arena conference in Lviv, Ukraine. This is the transcript of the interview, which was 50 minutes long: Mike Butcher (MB):You think that digital advertising agencies have Ã¢â¬Ëgot it comingÃ¢â¬â¢, such as the WPPs of this world. What do you mean by that? Alexander Nix (Nix):Actually, probably not digital advertising agencies because theyÃ¢â¬â¢re more progressive. IÃ¢â¬â¢m really looking at the old school traditional creative-led agencies. [For example] within WPP, obviously Martin (Sorrell) has made a huge effort to pivot his business. HeÃ¢â¬â¢s making a huge effort every day, acquiring 40+ companies a year, something like that. But when you look at the traditional approach to advertising, which is fundamentally driven by guesswork, albeit very intuitive and experienced guessworkÃ¢â¬Â¦ The advert I was thinking aboutÃ¢â¬Â¦ do you remember the CadburyÃ¢â¬â¢s advert of a gorilla playing the drums? I mean who could have known that that was going to be a national success? I mean, youÃ¢â¬â¢re telling me they went and opinion-surveyed 5,000 people and then decided to make a gorilla advert? Of course they didnÃ¢â¬â¢t! They just Ã¢â¬ËwingÃ¢â¬â¢d itÃ¢â¬â¢ and it happened to push peopleÃ¢â¬â¢s buttons and it was a great success. Well, that sort of advertising is going to be replaced by highly targeted, very personalized advertising, and that has to be data-driven. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s not replacing of creativity, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s using data to augment creativity. Data first then creativity. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s linear. MB:Looking at the figures on your website you said you drove 1.5% increase in favourability among people who saw your [US election campaign] ads. Not everyone who becomes more favourable after seeing that ad is going to change their vote for instance. Most of them had been planning to vote for Trump already or [the ad] wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t make enough difference to stop them voting for Hillary. But it might for influence a very small percentage of the electorate. That might have been enough to swing Michigan but not the whole election. Nix:How many states was the election won over? Four? I mean, winning Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, FloridaÃ¢â¬Â¦ That was pretty much it. MB:Because it came down the electoral college that you were targeting? Nix:It always comes down to that. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s always the roadmap to 270. That changes every day. You go in to the election: Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬â¢re thinking okay these are 12-14 battleground states.Ã¢â¬Â After six weeks youÃ¢â¬â¢re like: Ã¢â¬ÅChrist. That oneÃ¢â¬â¢s dead. Got to move. How do how do we get there how do we do the sums to get back to where we want to be?Ã¢â¬Â You know, you donÃ¢â¬â¢t need to and you canÃ¢â¬â¢t afford to focus on 50 states. YouÃ¢â¬â¢re looking atÃ¢â¬Â¦ you know youÃ¢â¬â¢re going to win these ones youÃ¢â¬â¢re never going to win those, so how do you get to where you want to go? MB:You said the people who saw Cambridge Analytica advertsÃ¢â¬Â¦ they likelihood of voting for Trump increased by 1 percent. IsnÃ¢â¬â¢t it that one of the companyÃ¢â¬â¢s claims? Nix:GoogleÃ¢â¬â¢s study was based on the impact of our digital campaign. It said [there was an ] 11.3 percent increase in favourability for Trump. An 8.3 percent increase in intent to vote for Trump. These are significant numbers. MB:So in 2017 you can claim you have psychological profiles of 220m U.S. citizens based on five thousand separate data sets? Nix:It actually works slightly different to that. We went out and we started to rollout a long form quantitive survey to probeÃ¢â¬â¢s psychographics. So we had hundreds of thousands of Americans fill out this survey. Completely independent from that we went and collected hundreds and then thousands of data points on every adult 230 million Americans. MB:This was publicly available data? Nix:This is publicly available data, this is client data, this is an aggregated third-party data. All sorts of data. In fact, weÃ¢â¬â¢re always acquiring more. Every day we have teams looking for new data sets. LetÃ¢â¬â¢s say based on the personality survey that weÃ¢â¬â¢ve identified five personality types, only, for the whole of America. And letÃ¢â¬â¢s say for each personality type weÃ¢â¬â¢ve got a hundred thousand people of type A and Type B and Type C. Well, weÃ¢â¬â¢ll look at the hundred thousand type A personalities, and then weÃ¢â¬â¢ll have a look at the corresponding data points that we have on those hundred thousand people. WeÃ¢â¬â¢ll have a look at what attributes they have in common and then weÃ¢â¬â¢ll build a model based on that. So if we identify that all type A personalities drive a lemon yellow car and wear Wellington boots and have a dog and three children and whatever, we can then make a prediction about everyone else in the universe who has a yellow car, a dog, Wellington boots and say well theyÃ¢â¬â¢re very likely to also have a type A personality based on their data. The best example I can give you [of] building a model [is that] in England we have a stereotype for conservatives, rural conservatives. They wear a barber [jacket], that Nigel Farage type. They wear a Barber and Wellington boots and have a Labrador, and they all went to private school, and they are therefore going to vote Tory. A stereotype but stereotypes are based on something. Well, that was four data points. Actually, itÃ¢â¬â¢s quite accurate in England. Imagine if you had 40 data points, or 400 and you extrapolated that they drive Land Rover, they like shooting, they both work in merchant banking and so on. You start to build up those data points and you can very accurately say Ã¢â¬ÅWell, I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know this personÃ¢â¬â¢s party political affiliation, but I do know they have a Barber and a Land Rover and a dog and they like shooting and work in merchant banking, therefore, theyÃ¢â¬â¢re likely to be a Tory. MB:So you call this psychographics? Nix:Yes. MB:But did you use psychographics in the Trump campaign or didnÃ¢â¬â¢t you? Nix:No, we didnÃ¢â¬â¢t. WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve been absolutely, incredibly clear about this. We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to TrumpÃ¢â¬â¢s campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didnÃ¢â¬â¢t have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (itÃ¢â¬â¢s probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as IÃ¢â¬â¢ve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly thereÃ¢â¬â¢s psychographic data thatÃ¢â¬â¢s baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because weÃ¢â¬â¢re not reinventing the wheel. [WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and weÃ¢â¬â¢ve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didnÃ¢â¬â¢t have time. We just couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t do that. MB:You say youÃ¢â¬â¢ve been building this data since the late 90s. We know FacebookÃ¢â¬â¢s terms of service in 2006 were quite different to what they are now. And actually there was quite a lot of data Ã¢â¬â scrape is probably too blunt a word Ã¢â¬â but data which you could pull out of Facebook then that you canÃ¢â¬â¢t pull out now. Was it the case that you had huge data sets on these people before the door started to close on the [Facebook] terms of service? Nix:Well, actually let me correct you. The company started in the early 90s or late 80s. We were a behavioural science company. We didnÃ¢â¬â¢t pivot into data analytics till 2012. So, all the data that we collected pre-2012, which was done by the British company SBL group, was collected through quantitive and qualitative research on the ground. Our modus operandi was to go and speak to, say, 100,000 people and start to use that to build on models. MB:Speak to them how? Via call centre surveys? Nix:Depending on the countryÃ¢â¬Â¦ I mean, in America, yes, call centres, the Internet where possible, face to faceÃ¢â¬Â¦ But in a country like Nigeria you know you just have teams and teams of students going out there knocking on doors. MB:So youÃ¢â¬â¢re doing that in Nigeria? Nix:Well, weÃ¢â¬â¢ve been doing that since our first election was 1994 for Mandela/ANC and since then weÃ¢â¬â¢ve done multiple elections every year. MB:Another claim CA makes is that you raised nearly $27m for Trump from 950,000 email addresses? Nix:No those are two separate things. We ran a Ã¢â¬Ësmall-dollarÃ¢â¬â¢ fundraising program. So what we did was we used our data to identify core Trump supporters. These are the diehard Trump supporters of which we estimate there are about 37-38 million people in America. And we then targeted them with a with a donor solicitation or small dollars solicitation campaign to ask them to send donations in. And we built all the data and all the mechanisms to do that. We raised that $27m within the first month of starting work. In total, obviously, that program went on to raise hundreds and millions of dollars. MB:Would you consider that to be being pivotal for their campaign? Nix:Well I think I think it was extremely pivotal because when Trump won the nomination he had very, very little money. And although he talked about putting a bit of money in himself, and he did put some money and some in as cash, most of it as loans, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s my understanding, you know, you were competing against the machine and she had dollars coming out of everywhere. Also there was a huge Ã¢â¬ÅNever TrumpÃ¢â¬Â faction in America. Most of the Republicans didnÃ¢â¬â¢t support him, and even those who ended up working for him didnÃ¢â¬â¢t support him. So the RNC, the Republican National Committee, didnÃ¢â¬â¢t support him. Ultimately they pivoted. A lot of the key RNC members were part of the Ã¢â¬ÅNever TrumpÃ¢â¬Â faction. They were behind his back. They were trying to destroy him. And eventually they all they did a complete U-turn. Part of the reason why we were thrust into such a prominent role in this campaign is because none of the vendors would support him. [Being among] Republican venderÃ¢â¬â¢s is an incredibly hostile environment. They were looking at this candidate and they said Ã¢â¬ÅWell, first and foremost we donÃ¢â¬â¢t like him.Ã¢â¬Â A typical presidential campaign will probably have five or eight different companies support it. YouÃ¢â¬â¢ll have a pollster, youÃ¢â¬â¢ll have a digital agency, youÃ¢â¬â¢ll have a TV agency, youÃ¢â¬â¢ll have a research firm. And then the campaign manager and the campaign committee will choose the best pollsters and the best thing or their best friend or however they figure these things out. Well, Trump won the nomination and all the Republicans said Ã¢â¬ÅWell, heÃ¢â¬â¢s going to get murdered by Hillary. If we work for him, the establishment of the RNC is going to hate us. WeÃ¢â¬â¢ll never get another dollar in U.S. politics again. So weÃ¢â¬â¢ll make a quick buck today, but itÃ¢â¬â¢s going to kill our career tomorrow.Ã¢â¬Â So a lot of them are like Ã¢â¬ÅweÃ¢â¬â¢d never want to touch this.Ã¢â¬Â So rather than having multiple vendors servicing his campaign, as is traditional, as Hillary had, we walked in there and said Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬â¢ll do your data analytics.Ã¢â¬Â And they were like: Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬â¢s no one doing research.Ã¢â¬Â [We said] we will do your research. Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬â¢s no doing digitalÃ¢â¬Â We will do digital. Ã¢â¬ÅThereÃ¢â¬â¢s no one doing TV.Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅWeÃ¢â¬â¢ll do your TV.Ã¢â¬Â WeÃ¢â¬â¢ll do your donations. And so overnight it went from being originally just data, to end to end. MB:Did you believe you were betting farm, as it were, on the campaign? Nix:Look, from my perspective it was an easy bet to make. It was a win-win. I couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t see the downside. I thought even if Trump didnÃ¢â¬â¢t prevail, if he didnÃ¢â¬â¢t win the election.Look, weÃ¢â¬â¢re a British firm that was trying to break into the most competitive political market in the world. And you know, we had some mixed press. But what really irritates me is when journalists go to get a quote about our work. And someone says Ã¢â¬ÅWe worked with Cambridge Analytica and their work didnÃ¢â¬â¢t really provide anything. It was rubbish.Ã¢â¬Â And then you have a look at who the quote was from and itÃ¢â¬â¢s from a direct competitor! And this is what the journalists havenÃ¢â¬â¢t quite figured out. A lot of the people that they speak to are people whose lunch weÃ¢â¬â¢re eating. We walked into [the US] market. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re competing with all the data teams. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re competing with all the digital teams, all the TV teams, all the research teams. YouÃ¢â¬â¢ve seen House of Cards. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s like that. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s the most vicious aggressive political culture both at the candidate level, that Trump is now finding out. At the campaign manager, GC level and at the vendor level. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a bloodbath. The knivesÃ¢â¬Â¦ [are out]. In DC, everyoneÃ¢â¬â¢s fucking everyone else. You see three quotes theyÃ¢â¬â¢re all from people whose business youÃ¢â¬â¢ve stolen. TheyÃ¢â¬â¢re saying things like we came across Ã¢â¬ÅCambridge Analytica. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s All snake oilÃ¢â¬Â [and itÃ¢â¬â¢s from] our biggest rival. MB:Do you think thereÃ¢â¬â¢s a mischaracterization of the tools used by targeted advertising campaigns, or so-called Ã¢â¬Ëcustom audienceÃ¢â¬â¢ campaigns, as being described as Ã¢â¬Ådark advertisingÃ¢â¬Â campaigns? Nix:ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world. And there are some things that I would definitely [say] IÃ¢â¬â¢m very proud of that weÃ¢â¬â¢re doing which are innovative. And there are some things which is best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which weÃ¢â¬â¢re taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics. Advertising agencies are using some of these techniques on a national scale. For us itÃ¢â¬â¢s been very refreshing, really breaking into the commercial and brand spaceÃ¢â¬Â¦ walking into a campaign where youÃ¢â¬â¢re basically trying to educate the market on stuff they simply donÃ¢â¬â¢t understand. You walk into a sophisticated brand or into an advertising agency, and the conversation [is sophisticated] You go straight down to: Ã¢â¬ÅAh, so youÃ¢â¬â¢re doing a programmatic campaign, you can augment that with some linear optimized dataÃ¢â¬Â¦ they understand it.Ã¢â¬Â They know itÃ¢â¬â¢s their world, and now it comes down to the nuances. Ã¢â¬ÅSo what exactly are you doing thatÃ¢â¬â¢s going to be a bit more effective and give us an extra 3 percent or 4 percent there.Ã¢â¬Â ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a delight. You know these are professionals who really get this world and thatÃ¢â¬â¢s where we want to be operating. MB:Do you regret the way your own business is being presented in the media? Nix:If thereÃ¢â¬â¢s any testament to whatÃ¢â¬â¢s driving the media just have a glance at Hillary ClintonÃ¢â¬â¢s recent book. The liberal press are supporting their candidate. They got fairly beaten and theyÃ¢â¬â¢re lashing out and trying to destroy every single person and every company that contributed to that defeat. Hillary simply cannot come to terms with it. SheÃ¢â¬â¢s a woman in denial. The liberal press [characterised Cambridge Analytica] as Ã¢â¬Åwitchcraft, they treat it is Ã¢â¬ÅvoodooÃ¢â¬Â and now itÃ¢â¬â¢s RussiaÃ¢â¬â¢s fault! They just cannot accept the fact that Hillary was such an unpopular, such a divisive candidate. She failed to mobilize her base and people didnÃ¢â¬â¢t fundamentally trust her. Rather than looking in the mirror, they much prefer to beat up Cambridge [Analytica] beat up Trump, beat up anyone else. Anything but accept the fact that their candidate wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t what the people wanted to vote for. MB:Would you would use your own methods to improve your own public image?A marketing campaign for yourself to create a better image for your own company? Nix:Would we rollout a national behavioural micro-targeting program to promote Cambridge Analytica? It probably wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t really achieve what weÃ¢â¬â¢re trying to do. I mean actually IÃ¢â¬â¢m just Ã¢â¬Ëdotting the IÃ¢â¬â¢s and crossing the TÃ¢â¬â¢sÃ¢â¬â¢ on a book which talks about our methodology and our approach to communications and I was speaking to the publisher about whether we should might target that. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a book hasnÃ¢â¬â¢t been published yet, itÃ¢â¬â¢ll come out next month, just talking really in quite technical terms about how communication is changing, what how technology is impacting that, what data is doing to advertising and political campaigns and then using a lot of case studies with a lot of real examples of artwork and targeting and psychographics and so forth to illustrate them. We were toying with the idea of [a campaign]. But I think itÃ¢â¬â¢s too complex to try and use our techniques to promote a book. It was more of a thought exercise right. It would mean having multiple versions multiple titles multiple dust sheets. MB:A/B testing for a book? Is the book coming out in the New Year? Nix:ItÃ¢â¬â¢s coming out in Germany first because it was a German publisher that approached us. It will be coming out in about the next month or so and then later in the U.K. MB:It is going to be about the company or methodology. Or your world view? Nix:The English title is not confirmed yet but I think it will be something like Ã¢â¬ÅMad men to maths menÃ¢â¬Â. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s going to be [about] the evolution of the advertising industry, how data, how psychology, how digital is changing an industry that really hasnÃ¢â¬â¢t changed very much. And what that disruption means in terms of an industry of you know multi-billion dollar industry and illustrating different campaigns that weÃ¢â¬â¢ve done to show the effectiveness of that. MB:On Brexit there were headlines such as Ã¢â¬ËThe great Brexit robbery, our democracy was hijackedÃ¢â¬â¢. How do you react to those? Nix:Well, look, I mean youÃ¢â¬â¢re implying therefore that we were involved in Brexit and part of that Ã¢â¬ÅrobberyÃ¢â¬Â. WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve been, again, crystal clear to all media including The Guardian, who really propagated this story from day one, based on nothing. Carole Cadwalladr has made it her personal mission to come after us again, living in denial about the outcome of the election. She cannot accept that the British people wanted to leave Europe and sheÃ¢â¬â¢s made it her mission to vilify us. We did not work on Brexit. We didnÃ¢â¬â¢t do a little bit of work. We didnÃ¢â¬â¢t do a lot of work. We did no work on Brexit. We were not involved in the campaign for either Leave.eu or Vote Leave, at all. And we have been crystal clear on this which is why weÃ¢â¬â¢re going to be taking them to court and weÃ¢â¬â¢re going to settle. MB:Why do you think you became associated with it then? Nix:Well because before the campaigns were launched we were approached by a number of different campaigns, pro and against, to discuss whether there might be a role for us on Brexit. And we had a number of discussions. Obviously, these discussions made their way into the public forum but we meet with hundreds of companies every year and talk about business opportunities. That doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t mean you engage with them doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t mean you contract with them and it certainly doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t mean that you work for them. But The Guardian came out with one or two data points and then created an entire narrative around that that was pure fiction. That went viral and then every other newspaper [piled into it]. If you tell a lie often enough it becomes truth. But even after we came out and denied that again and again and again they just kept propagating the same message. MB:But you are working in other campaigns. ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s been some controversy about Kenya and South Africa for instance. How do you react to those? Nix:Well, you are talking about Bell Pottinger, [which has] paid the consequences for some bad decisions. MB:Did you work on those campaigns? Nix:No, we werenÃ¢â¬â¢t involved with the actors. We werenÃ¢â¬â¢t involved with Bell Pottinger, we werenÃ¢â¬â¢t involved with the Guptas. In fact, I know very little about that. And I really canÃ¢â¬â¢t make a commentary on what happened. I know only what IÃ¢â¬â¢ve read in the paper. MB:You worked on the Kenya campaign? Nix:WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve worked all across Africa. MB:Kenya? Nix:Well, letÃ¢â¬â¢s wait till the electionÃ¢â¬â¢s over because we never talk about elections that live, generally, as a rule of thumb. But I can tell you that we worked in Kenya in 2013 on the last election for Kenyatta. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s well documented. I can speak to that. Look, Kenyatta won by 12 points and there were some few irregularities, from what IÃ¢â¬â¢ve read, in the way that the election oversight committeeÃ¢â¬Â¦ [granted] some of the tenders [for] election equipment. The opposition used these irregularities to challenge the outcome of the election. I think had this been a Ã¢â¬ÅFloridaÃ¢â¬Â years ago when it came down to half a percent, ok. But when youÃ¢â¬â¢re talking about a 12 percent victory I think that the courtÃ¢â¬â¢s decision to hold this [new] election was a dreadful decision. I think that it is going to result in dreadful bloodshed, horrific violence. If Kenyatta for any reason doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t win this election then his supporters are going to feel robbed. And if OdingaÃ¢â¬â¢s people donÃ¢â¬â¢t, theyÃ¢â¬â¢re going to feel that heÃ¢â¬â¢s cheated again because thatÃ¢â¬â¢s the perception that Odinga is put out into the public domain. I canÃ¢â¬â¢t see this ending well. I think just for the sake of Kenya, for peace in the region, I think itÃ¢â¬â¢s a dreadful decision. I actually canÃ¢â¬â¢t even see this election being resolved in the next month. I think itÃ¢â¬â¢s going to drag on. So, I think the courtÃ¢â¬â¢s decision was shortsighted. MB:WhatÃ¢â¬â¢s your answer to critics who claimed that youÃ¢â¬â¢ve worked on behalf of the Russian government or third party actors connect to them? Either for specifically in relation to TrumpÃ¢â¬â¢s campaign or to other campaigns. Nix:WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve never been asked directly. No one of authority has levelled any direct criticisms to us and, certainly, no one has suggested that weÃ¢â¬â¢d been or alleged that weÃ¢â¬â¢d been involved as far as IÃ¢â¬â¢m aware. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re not under investigation by anyone. We are helping wherever we can with the understandings of the campaign, like everyone else in the campaign, but thereÃ¢â¬â¢s no investigation into Cambridge [Analytica]. MB:IsnÃ¢â¬â¢t the U.S. Congress investigating you in connection with Russian attempts to interfere with the election? Nix:No, itÃ¢â¬â¢s not. The US Congress is undertakingÃ¢â¬Â¦ MB:The Atlantic magazine reported it. Nix:[Scoffs] Oh then it must be true! I donÃ¢â¬â¢t knowÃ¢â¬Â¦ I mean thatÃ¢â¬â¢s exactly what IÃ¢â¬â¢m talking about. My understanding is that the U.S. Congress is undertaking an investigation into Russian interference into the election and theyÃ¢â¬â¢ve asked all sorts of people for help into that. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s not suggesting in any way, any way at all, that Cambridge is under investigation. And you know weÃ¢â¬â¢re more than happy to help. We never worked in Russia. We never worked for Russia. I want to be careful, but I donÃ¢â¬â¢t think we have any Russian employees in our company whatsoever. We just donÃ¢â¬â¢t have business in Russia. We have no involvement with Russia, never have done. MB:What about for third parties associated with PutinÃ¢â¬â¢s government? Nix:I wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t even know who they were and where to begin. I mean, we worked directly for the campaign, as in directly, and we worked for a Super Pac in support of the campaign [called] Ã¢â¬Ådefeat crooked HillaryÃ¢â¬Â was itÃ¢â¬â¢s unofficial title or Ã¢â¬Åkeep the promiseÃ¢â¬Â or something. MB:You have an investor, Robert Mercer. What sort of independence that give you? He has known political views. Do you feel independent of an investor like that? Nix:Well, actually, IÃ¢â¬â¢m not going to speak about any of our investors or board members at all because we donÃ¢â¬â¢t. But I can answer your question which is Ã¢â¬Ëis our political ideology influenced by other people in the companyÃ¢â¬â¢ at whatever level? And the answer to that [is this]Ã¢â¬Â¦ We undertake 7 to 9 elections a year, somewhere in the world, for Prime Minister or President. And for as many of those are on the Left of Centre or the Right of Centre. In fact, if you were to total them up, I would probably say Ã¢â¬â and this is based on a guesstimate Ã¢â¬â that weÃ¢â¬â¢d done more Left-leaning than Right-leaning. Now, clearly in AmericaÃ¢â¬Â¦ MB:Can you give me any examples of those Left-leaning campaigns? Nix:YouÃ¢â¬â¢d have to go on our website. IÃ¢â¬â¢m sure you could find 25, and you can just see which parties. ItÃ¢â¬â¢ll all be there. But in America you have to pick a side. You canÃ¢â¬â¢t flip-flop. You are not encouraged work for the Democrats in one cycle and then move to the Republicans [on the next]. And the reason the Republicans were attractive to us was because the Democrats were significantly leading the tech arms race. Under Obama through Civas and Blue Labs they had pioneered the use of big data. They were using very sophisticated digital technologies. And the Republicans had been left behind. By the time Romney lost in 2012 there was a vacuum. There just wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t the tech talent on the Right to be able to compete. It was like taking a knife to a gunfight. And so that was the commercial opportunity. Now, the reason for that is because most of the tech community, and IÃ¢â¬â¢m going to generalize here, but a lot of the tech community that were politically oriented tended to lean Left. People in Berkeley and MIT, and so forth, would, if they were politically motivated, support Hillary or Obama. Whereas, people who might be more Right of centre, obviously, would look typically to go and work in banking or investment management with those skills. And so because of the dearth of talent the Republicans were getting murdered in the tech arms race. That was the commercial opportunity, that was the one we sought to address. Right? Had it been the other way around it might have been a different story. MB:What are your own personal political views? Do you talk about those?Nix:We leave our personal ideologies at the door. We think that being Ã¢â¬ÅforeignÃ¢â¬Â and objective is an asset in elections. I think that a lot of political campaigns, and in the U.S., a lot of campaign staff and vendors get blinded by their own ideology. They blindly believe in their candidate to an extent that they actually canÃ¢â¬â¢t see objectively whatÃ¢â¬â¢s happening in the campaign. They can only see what they and all their friends believe and therefore they assume thatÃ¢â¬â¢s representative of 200 million voters take MB:[YouÃ¢â¬â¢re saying] They project themselves onto campaigns? Nix:Yeah naturally. And thereÃ¢â¬â¢s something wonderful about coming into a foreign country as an outsider and looking with completely fresh eyes at a political landscape and be able to not have a clouded judgment. And thatÃ¢â¬â¢s what we bring. And equally, itÃ¢â¬â¢s like a good lawyer representing his or her client. You canÃ¢â¬â¢t go in there with a preconception of guilty or not. You have to go in there and look at the facts. And thatÃ¢â¬â¢s what we try to do. MB:Do you have a blacklist of anyone you wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t work for? Nix:Oh yes for sure. We only work for mainstream political parties. Tories, Labour, Republicans, Democrats. We steer clear of fringe political parties or minority groups. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re not trying to orchestrate a revolution. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re trying to provide the best techÃ¢â¬Â¦ communication technology to political parties. As I said before, elections are about 20 percent of our revenue as a company. WeÃ¢â¬â¢ve got about 20/25 percent in defence and homeland security. The rest is in the brand and commercial space. We are not a political company. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re a tech company, and we see ourselves as tech company. We have a tech culture, where we attract academics. You know a third of our staff are PhDs. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re geeks! Fundamentally, weÃ¢â¬â¢re a bunch of geeky people who are trying to solve problems and I would say that politics is probably the least desirable division in the company, because it can be divisive and people donÃ¢â¬â¢t necessarily like to get involved. But, if you give a data scientist a really challenging problem like identifying the ideology of a nation or an issue, a model or something, itÃ¢â¬â¢s about solving the problem. It is not about trying to promote their own personal ideology or agenda or anything like that. MB:YouÃ¢â¬â¢re working with Palantir? Nix:No. Palantir was established about nine or 10 years ago now. TheyÃ¢â¬â¢re very active of course in the defence, homeland security. They were a pioneer and a leader in this field. Peter Thiel, in applying both his platforms, Gotham and Metropolis, and other work which is slightly more off the radar, it is truly revolutionary. I mean these guys were genuine first movers. And I think that companies like us have caught up. But kudos to them. They were really very early on to the scene. MB:I think you count the Pentagon as a client donÃ¢â¬â¢t you? Nix:We formed a defence/government defence division in 2005. Over that period weÃ¢â¬â¢ve worked for global militaries all over the world. We train a lot of armies in something called PSYOP, which is psychological operations or information operations, which is, sort of communication warfare. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s trying to understand how to persuade troops not to fight or to persuade your troops to fight. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s trying to combat hostile behaviour or how do you counter radicalization or counter-terrorism, and so forth. We do a lot of information operation programs ourselves [where] we go in to countries and conduct the research and the campaigns to change behaviour to reduce conflict. And our clients do include, in the U.K, the MOD and the FCO, and in the United States, all the Ã¢â¬ËcomsÃ¢â¬â¢, so NorthCom, Safcom, State Department, Pentagon and various Ã¢â¬Ëthree letter agenciesÃ¢â¬â¢ and so forth. MB:WhatÃ¢â¬â¢s your whatÃ¢â¬â¢s your vision for the future? YouÃ¢â¬â¢ve talked about psychographic profiling, analytics about the amount of data sets there are, and the data you can pull out social media. And of course, we all know that AlexaÃ¢â¬â¢s in their houses recording what they are saying. Where do you see things heading? Firstly, which direction do you feel your own company is going in, given the amount of data out there? Secondly, do you think you might end up butting up against the Google and Amazons in data collection? Nix:There are several questions there. LetÃ¢â¬â¢s start with the bigger picture. There are two technologies that IÃ¢â¬â¢m really excited by and that everyone is talking about. Clearly, IOT is going to totally radicalize the data market. I think the data business is doomed, myself. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a very, very high volume and very low margin [business]. As the internet of things grows, as we have sensors on everything: cars, fridges, TVs then data is going to become ubiquitous. Therefore the volume of data will increase, the price of data is going to go down. You wonÃ¢â¬â¢t be able to sell data in the way you can today. I think people are going to start taking control of their data much more. There is going to be more reciprocity in the way that people share their data with companies like my own and other marketing agencies. But generally, the increase in data is one factor that is going to make analytics companies like ours more valuable. More data is going to need more analytics, period. And then at the other end Ã¢â¬â if you see it as a sandwich and weÃ¢â¬â¢re in the middle Ã¢â¬â youÃ¢â¬â¢ve got blockchain. And by having distributed ledger technology youÃ¢â¬â¢re going to an ability to have transparency, and to have accountability as to how data is and data sets are being used and implemented, forevermore, in perpetuity. And so, yes the data landscape is getting more frightening with IOT. But on the other hand, itÃ¢â¬â¢s going to be to be more self-regulated through the Blockchain and itÃ¢â¬â¢s going to be more transparent. And both of those things are the bread rolls with the analytics being the chess in the middle of the sandwich. Analytics are going to play more and more of a function in deciphering huge quantities of data, making sense of it, applying it into many different areas and then using blockchain technologies to securitise that. In terms of the advertising industry: Look, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve been very vocal about this but I donÃ¢â¬â¢t think that, again, IÃ¢â¬â¢m sort of some sort of Ã¢â¬ËsoothsayerÃ¢â¬â¢. I think a lot of people in the industry recognize thisÃ¢â¬Â¦ And even if they are only whispering to each otherÃ¢â¬Â¦ I think the advertising industry is like lemmings on the edge of a cliff. They canÃ¢â¬â¢t go backwards and forwards looks terrifying. Omnicom, Dentsu, WPPÃ¢â¬Â¦ theyÃ¢â¬â¢re trying to pivot. TheyÃ¢â¬â¢re acquiring companies left right and centre. But you canÃ¢â¬â¢t just buy a data company and squash it together with an ad agency and hope itÃ¢â¬â¢s just going to work. It doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t work like that, that itÃ¢â¬â¢s a different culture. It takes integration. You need to grow these things together. YouÃ¢â¬â¢ve got all the consultancies which saw a commercial opportunity in the last two or three years and started acquiring data companies. TheyÃ¢â¬â¢re trying to acquire advertising agencies in order to get into this space. Then nipping at the heels of the big conglomerates and taking considerable market share from them. YouÃ¢â¬â¢ve got the big brands themselves understanding their data is so valuable they no longer want to give that away to advertising agencies. They can bring some of these capabilities in-house and have their own data analytics and marketing agencies in-house. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s damaging them. Then youÃ¢â¬â¢ve got the small disruptors like us who are only going to become more numerous. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re eating a piece of the pie. So, I think there is going to be a reckoning, and itÃ¢â¬â¢s happening now. WPPÃ¢â¬â¢s market share has taken a nosedive in the last month or three. But theyÃ¢â¬â¢re not going to be the only ones. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s going to continue. IÃ¢â¬â¢m not suggesting that theyÃ¢â¬â¢re all going to go bust, but I am saying itÃ¢â¬â¢s Ã¢â¬Åadapt or dieÃ¢â¬Â. This market is fundamentally shifting and about time too! This is overdue. Gone are the days where an advertiser does an advert. And as long as the clientÃ¢â¬â¢s wife likes it there are no metrics other than audience recall to quantify its success. Or very few. And they donÃ¢â¬â¢t care anymore. They can just squeeze a lemon and get some money out of advertisers. I think that advertisers want more accountability, they want more measurement of effectiveness, they want empirical data to be able to justify these enormous multi-billion dollar spends. MB:LetÃ¢â¬â¢s fast forward say,10-20 years. There will be people who can afford to buy privacy and then there will be plenty of people who will give away their data in return for services, as they do now. Do we do we think that thatÃ¢â¬â¢s a good situation to be in? WhatÃ¢â¬â¢s your view? Nix:I think gone are the days where people just click a box without really thinking it through, and all their data has just been siphoned away and gone. Grabbed. I think people are recognizing that data is valuable AND that theyÃ¢â¬â¢re [also] saying, Ã¢â¬ÅWell actually itÃ¢â¬â¢s not that sensitive. I donÃ¢â¬â¢t really care much if people understand my shopping habits or what car I drive. This isnÃ¢â¬â¢t health or financial data. But it is valuable and why should I just give it away so that other firms and advertisers can make money out of it?Ã¢â¬Â So I see more of a reciprocity. I see people having something like a virtual data wallet. TheyÃ¢â¬â¢re going to have control of their data. YouÃ¢â¬â¢ll be able to say to them Ã¢â¬ÅHey can I licence your data or use your data for a certain campaign or purpose?Ã¢â¬Â And thereÃ¢â¬â¢s going to be an exchange there. TheyÃ¢â¬â¢re going to say Ã¢â¬ÅYes you can but itÃ¢â¬â¢s going to cost you 10 percent off thatÃ¢â¬Â or Ã¢â¬ÅI want this in return.Ã¢â¬Â And I see that market emerging as people take control. I think thatÃ¢â¬â¢s really sensible. I think it gives people more control and therefore it gives them more protection. I think advertisers will need to be a little more targeted in the way that they use data and they gather data, which is probably good. But actually, itÃ¢â¬â¢s not going to dent the industry or the direction that itÃ¢â¬â¢s growing in. So I really hope that people like the ICO [Information CommissionerÃ¢â¬â¢s Office in the UK which rules on data privacy for individuals], who are suddenly trying to catch up on the last five years of data. I hope that they understand that the regulation needs to be there to protect consumers, but not to stump the growth of an industry that could really do a lot of good. Not just in communications, [but] across all corporate sectors. MB:If consumers had more control over their data wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t that start to slightly stump the work that you do? Nix:No, I donÃ¢â¬â¢t think it will because I think things are changing. I think that the older generation, our parents or even olderÃ¢â¬Â¦ you know, this is a terrifying brave new world for them. Ã¢â¬ÅWhat do you mean someone knows what car I drive?!Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅYes, mother they do know what car you driveÃ¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅBut thatÃ¢â¬â¢s awful!Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅWhy is it awful?Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅWell because I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t want them to know that!Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅDo you care?Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅThatÃ¢â¬â¢s not the point.Ã¢â¬Â Ã¢â¬ÅWell, it is the point!Ã¢â¬Â Actually, the new generation, the next generation, younger than us, they donÃ¢â¬â¢t care. They actually just donÃ¢â¬â¢t care. MB:They are used to this world? Nix:They are used to this world and they realize it. Ã¢â¬ÅDo I care if people know what car I drive, what cereal I eat for breakfast?Ã¢â¬Â And why should they, really? They donÃ¢â¬â¢t care if they put a picture of themselves blind drunk on Facebook doing something. They donÃ¢â¬â¢t care. Let alone [someone knowing] what car they drive. MB:Do they care if they feel that it might influence an election? Nix:Well, thatÃ¢â¬â¢s a good question. Ultimately, I donÃ¢â¬â¢t think people are naive, now, especially not the Internet generation, the Millennials. I think they do understand whatÃ¢â¬â¢s going on. ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s been so much press. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s not about hoodwinking people. Remember, itÃ¢â¬â¢s the same for all sides. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s not like Trump had some secret sauce that he was employing with Cambridge that the Democrats didnÃ¢â¬â¢t. HillaryÃ¢â¬â¢s data and digital teams were up to 200 people or something! Huge! Huge! This was tried and tested. It was a machine! They were doing everything! But the reason theyÃ¢â¬â¢re not in the spotlight is twofold. A: Hillary lost. And B: TrumpÃ¢â¬â¢s, you know, is somewhat perceived by many as more of a polarizing character. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s why. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s not what we did. I mean, I think if weÃ¢â¬â¢d done exactly the same work, no different, but done it for HillaryÃ¢â¬Â¦ MB:You think the result would have been the same? Nix:No, I think no one would care. The Guardian wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t be writing these stupid headlines and nor would The New York Times. They wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t care. This is not about Cambridge. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s not about our tech. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s about Trump. It was always kind of shady that Facebook let you volunteer your friendsÃ¢â¬â¢ status updates, check-ins, location, interests and more to third-party apps. While this let developers build powerful, personalized products, the privacy concerns led Facebook to announce at F8 2014 that it would shut down the Friends data API in a year. Now that time has come, with the forced migration to Graph API v2.0 leading to the friendsÃ¢â¬â¢ dataÃÂ API shutting down, and a few other changes happening on April 30. Today Facebook assembled journalists in San Francisco to discuss the rhetoric behind the change. All apps created since April 20, 2014, already have the new systems, so youÃ¢â¬â¢ve probably seen them in the wild. But all new developers must comply with updated APIs, or their connection to Facebook will stop working. Job Fusion will have to shut down its referral engine Some users will see it as a positive move that returns control of personal data to its rightful owners. Just because youÃ¢â¬â¢re friends with someone, doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t mean you necessarily trust their judgment about what developers are safe to deal with. Now, each user will control their own data destiny. Along with the year notice, Facebook reviewed 5,000 of the top apps and sent them feedback about how their app will perform after the change. Its goal has been to minimize the impact on users. FacebookÃ¢â¬â¢s Simon Cross told reporters that Mark Zuckerberg said one of FacebookÃ¢â¬â¢s new slogans is Ã¢â¬ËPeople FirstÃ¢â¬â¢, because Ã¢â¬Åif people donÃ¢â¬â¢t feel comfortable using Facebook and specifically logging in Facebook and using Facebook in apps, we donÃ¢â¬â¢t have a platform, we donÃ¢â¬â¢t have developers.Ã¢â¬Â To inform its new policies, Facebook did extensive in-person research, asking users how they felt about their privacy when they used Facebook with apps. It came away believing that to ensure the long-term health of the ecosystem, itÃÂ has to give users confidence in how their app privacy is handled. When people are confident, Ã¢â¬Åthey feel happier and use our stuff more, and thatÃ¢â¬â¢s what weÃ¢â¬â¢re tying to achieveÃ¢â¬Â says Cross. On the other hand, some developers will have significantly change how their apps work, or turn them off altogether. For example, Job Fusion relied on the ability to pull where a userÃ¢â¬â¢s friends work to show them job openings at those companies. Now Job Fusion is shutting downÃÂ its referral engine, though it will continue operating in different ways. Others going dark or that already have due to the change include CareerSonar, Jobs With Friends, and adzuna Connect. Along with the friends data API change, Facebook is now requiring all apps to use its new login system, which gives users more granular control over what data they give developers.ÃÂ Previously, users provided all their data and permissions in two big screens. One for all personal info and one for the ability for an app to post to Facebook on your behalf. Now on the log-in screen, developers must include an Ã¢â¬ÅEdit the info you provideÃ¢â¬Â link, which opens a checklist of all the data and permissions theyÃ¢â¬â¢re asking for, including friend list, Likes, email address, and the ability to post to the News Feed. Users can tap the checkmarks to deny certain permissions. Lastly, Facebook has now instituted Login Review, where a team of its employees audit any app that requires more than the basic data of someoneÃ¢â¬â¢s public profile, list of friends, and email address. The Login Review team has now checked over 40,000 apps, and from the experience, created new, more specific permissions so developers donÃ¢â¬â¢t have to ask for more than they need. Facebook revealed that apps now ask an average of 50 percent fewer permissions than before. So what does April 30 mean for users? In some cases, nothing. Apps that donÃ¢â¬â¢t need extra permissions and that function if theyÃ¢â¬â¢re missing some like your email address will automatically get the new login systems and will work normally, and users wonÃ¢â¬â¢t have to log back in. If a developer is significantly changing an app or needs more permissions, users may need to log back in, or the app might perform weirdly or show roadblock error messages. And some apps may simply cease to exist. Apps donÃ¢â¬â¢t have to delete data theyÃ¢â¬â¢ve already pulled. If someone gave your data to an app, it could go on using it. However, if you request that a developer delete your data, it has to. However, how you submit those requests could be through a form, via email, or in other ways that vary app to app. You can also always go to your App Privacy SettingsÃÂ and remove permissions for an app to pull more data about you in the future. Overall, the changes could boost confidence in FacebookÃ¢â¬â¢s platform and the social network itself, which has struggled in the past with a reputation for spotty privacy. Cross says the conversion rate on people logging in with Facebook has increased 11 percentÃÂ andÃÂ believes this means Ã¢â¬ÅMore people feel comfortable logging in with Facebook.Ã¢â¬Â FacebookÃ¢â¬â¢s never been shy about prioritizing users over developers and advertisers. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s repeatedly reduced app virality to protect usersÃ¢â¬â¢ feeds from spam, and denied advertiser requests for more flashy, site takeover-style ads. Facebook knows that if it burns users now, usage will wither, and all developers will get hurt. And while developers might not like the changes, Facebook tried to give them as much warning as possible."}

Photo: loic venance/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images You canât put a price on trust, but for Facebook, FB -0.17% at least, the lack of it is getting expensive. That was readily apparent Monday, when Facebookâs share price slid nearly 7%, making for the stockâs worst single-day drop in at least four years. That equated to more than $36 billion in market value lost as lawmakers erupted in fury over the latest scandal involving the companyâs role in the contentious 2016 U.S. presidential election as well as the U.K.âs Brexit vote months earlier. Facebook was under intense scrutiny already. Revelations that user data found its way to a third-party analytics firm that was using the information for political purposes sparked a fresh round of criticism. European Union officials have promised a probe, while several U.S. politicians are calling for the same. The company says it already has suspended Cambridge Analytica, the firm in question, over the issue. About 1.4 billion people log into Facebook on a daily basis, and the company has reliably grown that number by double-digit rates every year since it went public in 2011. That impressive expansion has allowed Facebook to quickly build up an advertising business now generating $40 billion a year in revenue. But that business is based on trustâspecifically trust from users that their private information wonât be used for malicious purposes. The swirling controversies around the social networkâs role in election campaigns and public discourse cuts to the core of Facebookâs value propositionâparticularly if it causes users to curb their activity on the network. But Facebookâs immense scale also has made it virtually impossible for alternatives to catch on. That, in turn, makes abuse of the platform more urgent for lawmakers. How precisely they may do that remains unknown, which is why political risk is difficult for investors to model. Facebookâs current multiple of just under 24 times forward earnings is near a record low and could appear tempting to those drawn to the companyâs strong growth and enviable profit margins. The stock now even trades at a slight discount to Microsoft, a one-time tech juggernaut that dominated a previous era with its own long history of tangles with lawmakers. But consider that Microsoft also carried a similar multiple in 2003, when the European Union issued its first big fine against company, alleging anticompetitive behavior. Microsoftâs valuation then collapsed by nearly 30% over the next four years as the companyâs battle with regulators intensified, even though its business grew about 60% during that same time. A similar drop for Facebook might look unlikely at this stage, but it canât be written off. Broken friendships donât mend overnight."}

This original idea and concept blossomed into something that influenced and sculpted the childhoods of many, myself included. It became Disneyâs, âThe Lion King.â For me, it, and other Disney films, nurtured something important and essential for anyone with an ideaâââimagination. So in a way, it could be argued that Charlie Fink the guy who came up with the idea of âBambi in Africaâ during his time at Disney laid down fertile soil for an idea like Bubbled to grow. Fink is a former Disney, AOL and AG Interactive executive who writes about VR, AR and new media for Forbes. In the 90s, Fink was EVP & COO of VR pioneer Virtual World Entertainment. He is now a consultant and frequent speaker on these topics at conferences like CES, SXSW, AWE, ARiA NYU, ARiA MIT, Digital Hollywood, VR Toronto (keynote), VR Voice Entertainment Summit (keynote), and âOn The Lotâ by VRS (keynote). In short, he knows AR. We had a chat about the AR cloud a few weeks back. He is absolutely right, of course. Web 2.0âââThe Old Internet From the dotcom boom, a number of companies emerged that became so large that they eclipsed the original purpose of Tim Berner-Leeâs vision for the internet being âa collaborative medium, a place where we could all meet and read and write.â John Battelle and Tim OâReilly outlined their definition of the âWeb as Platformâ, where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, was that the âcustomers are building your business for youâ. Google and Facebook are perfect examples of how in web 2.0 a user is invited to contribute to the siteâs content by commenting on published articles or creating a user account or profile on the site, which may enable increased participation. By increasing emphasis on these already-extant capabilities, they encourage the user to rely more on their browser for user interface, application software (âappsâ) and file storage facilities. These companies, along with others like Apple and Microsoft have made it extremely easy to navigate what we call the âinternetâ but what in reality areâââsiloed platforms owned by these centrally governed companies; all of whom have investors to answer to. The monopoly of the internet by these monolithic companies is virtually absolute. They control the app store markets they facilitate; any innovation that occurs off platform they acquire, any new markets that surface they will dominate. Augmented reality cannot be the same. Level 1 are apps built on centralized app platforms, Level 2 are built independently but laterÂ acquired Decentralized Web 3.0 vs. Business as Usual Finkâs observation is correctâââif the AR cloud is to be centralized. Gatekeepers, like Apple and Google are the guys you have to cosy up to if you want to succeed in building and delivering a centralized AR cloud as they are providing the toolkit for you to build, store and deliver your vision, via namely arkit and arcoreâââhowever, decentralization hands the keys back into the hands of the community. It removes the âBusiness as Usualâ scenario, where the centralized web giants continue in dominating a market which has become rife with: Indiscriminate use of personal data Curtailing of content creator benefits Fake news Inappropriate content Decentralization is the movement of departments within a organization away from a single point of administration. Decentralization, when enacted out using distributed ledger technology (Blockchain) enables the consolidation of functions usually performed by set departments within a large organisation, to be performed by a smart contract, digitally. This means tasks like data storage, decision making and content management are not managed centrally but rather, autonomously run; managed by pre-programmed smart contracts more commonly known as âcryptocurrency.â What does this mean for the end user? Users get to interact directly with each other, without the interaction taking place on a platform centrally controlled by a company seeking ways to monetise the information they share. Content they create can be monetised and sold directly P2P, without the need of a 3rd party platform hosting the content on centrally held servers and charging a 70/30 revenue split. Apps, known as dApps (Decentralized Apps) when built on the blockchain are interfaces that allow a user to access a specific set of functions using a blockchainâs protocol via a platforms unique set of smart contracts aka cryptocurrency. The only barrier to access is whether or not the user holds the cryptocurrency needed to unlock the function of the platformââânot third parties and their fees. Blockchain, Protocols and Underpants Gnomes The âUnderpants Gnomesâ comment references the infamous episode in South Park where a group of gnomes have been stealing underpants as part of a bigger plan, broken down into three phases: Phase 1: Collect Underpants Phase 2:Â ? Phase 3: Profit When the gnomes are pressed on the question mark and asked how, exactly, they get from underpants to profits, they donât have a good answer. Again, Fink highlights one of the biggest issues with a lot of projects in the blockchain space. Many are building really innovative, decentralised infrastructures that have the potential to solve real world issues but without taking steps to identify, describe and develop a business case that serves real world business needs and have the potential to realise profit via a dApp. The Bubbled Platform Phase 1âââCollect Underpants Level 1 is the Bubbled platform that identifies and enables holders of the smart contract BBL to purchase unique geo-locations on the blockchain and create a new type of fungible digital asset. Holders of this virtual land can then register (or not) for the BFAR (http://bfar.org.uk) to support the code of conduct, starting the building of a framework of governance for AR content placed in real-world locations. Using decentralised storage protocols such as IPFS enables AR content to be uploaded locally based on the creators geo-location and pulled by other users locally that want to access that content. Key features of a decentralized AR cloud: âWe use content-addressing so content can be decoupled from origin servers, and instead, can be stored permanently. This means content can be stored and served very close to the user, perhaps even from a computer in the same room. Content-addressing allows us to verify the data too, because other hosts may be untrusted. And once the userâs device has the content, it can be cached indefinitely.â Content-addressing and content-signing protect IPFS-based sites, making DDoS attacks impossible. And to help mitigate the damage of discontinued websites, IPFS also archives important public-record content, and can easily store important, public-record content. Phase 2âââ? There is a need for decentralised business entities to translate the activity that occurs within the crypto-universe into a profit making and therefore âtaxable supplyâ in the fiat-universe. This is level 2. Identifying a present or future market opportunity that can allow a solution to be built, creating a credible and profit making business. There are already steps being taken to enable businesses to start advertising in AR; however these solutions will be centralised. The Branded and cLand dApps are solutions which allow real-world companies who want to take steps to share branded content in this new medium. They provide an interface to let these businesses connect to virtual landowners and AR content providers creating a new marketplace. The decentralised community are governed by the BBL smart contracts and can directly monetise their activity within the crypto-universe in fiat terms, based on their efforts on the Bubbled platform. No more trying to find a bank to convert their ROI from flipping crypto on exchanges; we enable a way to monetise directly in the fiat world without paying any 3rd parties for your efforts. The Bubbled AR viewer and SDK enables apps to update and provide a window to a ubiquitous metaverse for their existing community; AR developers have access to an ever-growing community on a global platform to create their own decentral solutions. The Blocklord dApp is one such solution, an ethereum-based game which uses the Bubbled platform to identify parcels for a blockchain based version of âMonopoly.â We also only connect these businesses to actors who subscribe to a global code of conduct as members of BFAR, helping form a layer of protection against potential legal action in this rapidly emerging, yet wholly ungoverned market. Phase 3âââProfit Our company, which facilitates the interface of these decentralised applications realise revenue from a subscription-based business model payable by the subscribing businesses seeking to connect to owners of decentralized virtual spaces and creators of AR content. This is level 3 in the diagram. We are still in the early stages of AR and the decentralization of web 3.0, but with AR predicted to be the next trillion dollar industry and the growth of the cryptocurrency market cap from $20bn in January 2017 to $450bn January 2018âââit is clear to see we are at the beginning stages of the evolution of visual communications and a new type of currency.

Zuckerberg offered roughly 8 sentences in response to Arrington's question about where privacy was going on Facebook and around the web. I'll post those sentences on their own first, then follow up with the questions they raise in my mind. You can also watch the video below, the privacy part we transcribe is from 3:00 to 4:00. Zuckerberg: \"When I got started in my dorm room at Harvard, the question a lot of people asked was 'why would I want to put any information on the Internet at all? Why would I want to have a website?' \"And then in the last 5 or 6 years, blogging has taken off in a huge way and all these different services that have people sharing all this information. People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds, but more openly and with more people. That social norm is just something that has evolved over time. \"We view it as our role in the system to constantly be innovating and be updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms are. \"A lot of companies would be trapped by the conventions and their legacies of what they've built, doing a privacy change - doing a privacy change for 350 million users is not the kind of thing that a lot of companies would do. But we viewed that as a really important thing, to always keep a beginner's mind and what would we do if we were starting the company now and we decided that these would be the social norms now and we just went for it.\" That's Not a Believable Explanation This is a radical change from the way that Zuckerberg pounded on the importance of user privacy for years. That your information would only be visible to the people you accept as friends was fundamental to the DNA of the social network that hundreds of millions of people have joined over these past few years. Privacy control, he told me less than 2 years ago, is \"the vector around which Facebook operates.\" I don't buy Zuckerberg's argument that Facebook is now only reflecting the changes that society is undergoing. I think Facebook itself is a major agent of social change and by acting otherwise Zuckerberg is being arrogant and condescending. Perhaps the new privacy controls will prove sufficient. Perhaps Facebook's pushing our culture away from privacy will end up being a good thing. The way the company is going about it makes me very uncomfortable, though, and some of the changes are clearly bad. It is clearly bad to no longer allow people to keep the pages they subscribe to private on Facebook. This major reversal, backed-up by superficial explanations, makes me wonder if Facebook's changing philosophies about privacy are just convenient stories to tell while the company shifts its strategy to exert control over the future of the web. Facebook's Different Stories First the company kept user data siloed inside its site alone, saying that a high degree of user privacy would make users comfortable enough to share more information with a smaller number of trusted people. Now that it has 350 million people signed up and connected to their friends and family in a way they never have been before - now Facebook decides that the initial, privacy-centric, contract with users is out of date. That users actually want to share openly, with the world at large, and incidentally (as Facebook's Director of Public Policy Barry Schnitt told me in December) that it's time for increased pageviews and advertising revenue, too. The Flimsy Evidence What makes Facebook think the world is becoming more public and less private? Zuckerberg cites the rise of blogging \"and all these different services that have people sharing all this information.\" That last part must mean Twitter, right? But blogging is tiny compared to Facebook! It's made a big impact on the world, but only because it perhaps doubled or tripled the small percentage of people online who publish long-form text content. Not very many people write blogs, almost everyone is on Facebook. Facebook's Barry Schnitt told us last month that he too believes the world is becoming more open and his evidence is Twitter, MySpace, comments posted to newspaper websites and the rise of Reality TV. But Facebook is bigger and is growing much faster than all of those other things. Do they really expect us to believe that the popularity of reality TV is evidence that users want their Facebook friends lists and fan pages made permanently public? Why cite those kinds phenomena as evidence that the red hot social network needs to change its ways? The company's justifications of the claim that they are reflecting broader social trends just aren't credible. A much more believable explanation is that Facebook wants user information to be made public and so they \"just went for it,\" to use Zuckerberg's words from yesterday. (Why didn't Arrington press Zuckerberg on stage about this? The rise of blogging is evidence that Facebook needs to change its fundamental stance on privacy?) This is Very Important Facebook allows everyday people to share the minutia of their daily lives with trusted friends and family, to easily distribute photos and videos - if you use it regularly you know how it has made a very real impact on families and social groups that used to communicate very infrequently. Accessible social networking technology changes communication between people in a way similar to if not as intensely as the introduction of the telephone and the printing press. It changes the fabric of peoples' lives together. 350 million people signed up for Facebook under the belief their information could be shared just between trusted friends. Now the company says that's old news, that people are changing. I don't believe it. I think Facebook is just saying that because that's what it wants to be true. Whether less privacy is good or bad is another matter, the change of the contract with users based on feigned concern for users' desires is offensive and makes any further moves by Facebook suspect."}

And there is a real chance that, once lost, those who grow up in the digital age â in which the power to command and shape peopleâs attention is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few companies â will have difficulty regaining it. MUNICH â The current moment in world history is a painful one. Open societies are in crisis, and various forms of dictatorships and mafia states, exemplified by Vladimir Putinâs Russia, are on the rise. In the United States, President Donald Trump would like to establish his own mafia-style state but cannot, because the Constitution, other institutions, and a vibrant civil society wonât allow it. Not only is the survival of open society in question; the survival of our entire civilization is at stake. The rise of leaders such as Kim Jong-un in North Korea and Trump in the US have much to do with this. Both seem willing to risk a nuclear war in order to keep themselves in power. But the root cause goes even deeper. Mankindâs ability to harness the forces of nature, both for constructive and destructive purposes, continues to grow, while our ability to govern ourselves properly fluctuates, and is now at a low ebb. The rise and monopolistic behavior of the giant American Internet platform companies is contributing mightily to the US governmentâs impotence. These companies have often played an innovative and liberating role. But as Facebook and Google have grown ever more powerful, they have become obstacles to innovation, and have caused a variety of problems of which we are only now beginning to become aware.

George Soros is Chairman of Soros Fund Management and Chairman of the Open Society Foundations. A pioneer of the hedge-fund industry, he is the author of many books, including The Alchemy of Finance, The New Paradigm for Financial Markets: The Credit Crisis of 2008 and What it Means, and The Tragedy of the European Union. This is a logical misinterpretation because Facebook have to compete with rivals which are going to come in future as well as have to face rivals from other companies and should not lose its integrity.All these factors will come into picture for the rise of any comapany In the US siloed institutions propagandize and politicize issue for their own gain and dominance. The success of an institution is measured in money and power. Owners and workers for those institutions act aggressively in the service of their own institution, in combat with other institutions, wittingly or unwittingly.The Nordic concept that what is good for 'The People' supersedes what is good for the siloed institution and its supporters is a socialist concept, not a free market concept, and means government regulation of institutions to ensure their disparate activities support an agreeable and successful 'community of all'.Needless to say, US siloed institutional culture is in combat with government regulatory efforts to create an agreeable society in America that is good for 'The People'. Nordic countries are homogeneous. There is no way we can use them as a template for the United States, the least homogeneous country in the world. This isn't apples to apples. This is apples to snails. It's not just social media that exploits society it's traditional media as well. The \"news\" is also totally beholden to advertising. The more minds they capture the more advertising revenue they earn, the more salaries they are paid and the more profits they make. \"Free speech\" today isn't free, it's beholden to advertisers and the strategies needed to capture their dollars. The idea that we must protect people because we cannot trust them to think critically on their own is a very dangerous one. The idea we must use government to decide what can get published into the marketplace of ideas is even more dangerous. Somehow Soros has twisted his own philosophical learnings into the opposite of what he professes to value. Great trader, dangerous and misguided thinker. I think you need to re-read his writing. Please point out the sentence where he says \"we must use gov't to decide what can get published\"? I don't see that anywhere. He wants to OPEN things further and not put all information TRANSMISSION (as opposed to CONTENT) in the hands of multiple players so it is not monopolized by a few corporations. It seemed pretty clear to me.... M Dallas, Soros has no mandate so is simply a lobbyist. Furthermore he appears a petulant lobbyist. For example when his recent 400K GBP funding of a anti brexit group was criticised he added another 100K because he was being criticised. That sort of maturity is not welcome with anything important. Soros does not change the number of multinational players on the internet We need to get away from the idea that fake news was invented by \"populists\", or by Russia, for that matter. \"Spin\" and \"spin doctors\" long pre-date Trump or Farage. The establishment has always used \"spin\" and fake news. The establishment only objects to it when it's being done by someone else. A solution to social media might be found through market principles. The same logic which broke up Standard Oil and AT&T applies to the tech giants, but today's politicians lack the guts (or the integrity?) to act. Interesting, but there is a difference between \"spin\" and \"fake news.\" Spin is agreeing on the same basic facts (let's say what journalists have found through interviews, data, etc), but INTERPRETING it through a different \"frame\" or lens. Fake news is claiming that journalists are just making up stories and information and data (like fiction writers). Such as when Trump said that there were more people at his Inauguration than ever before, ignoring the EVIDENCE of two pictures of Obama and Trump put side-to-side. That is fake news of the most dangerous type -- created by our elected leaders (perhaps fed to them by their advisers with their own interests) with the power over life and death. IF HOWEVER, when the US Intelligence agencies later declared that there was no evidence of WMD in Irag AND Bush/Blair STILL insisted that the pictures were falsified or somehow undermined the integrity of the intelligence agencies by claiming \"fake news\" (think: Trump), then you've got a much more dangerous leader. Bush/Blair did not go there, as far as I remember. M Dallas, I'm not interested in excuses or 'we got it wrong' type messaging re war from Blair or Bush just that it went ahead against democratic opposition, certainly in the UK. The 'not in my name' protest was ignored. Blair still argues what he did was justified when it wasnt Steve, the original debate is about what is \"spin\" and what is \"fake news\" so your comment is a non sequitor. Blair/Bush is just an example. But, regardless, your memory seems short. During the war 54% of Brits SUPPORTED the war -- unfortunately, democracy is sometimes wrong. (I was in the streets in San Francisco protesting the war, so I'm not pro-war....I am simply trying to define terms and use evidence to examine issues). Here is the UK opinion polls (I would guess that the US numbers were even higher): M Dallas. I dont think a 54% support for war is that surprising when a charismatic leader who believes he is guided by god is pounding the desk and propounding there are WMD. The point is substantial concern about the war prospect and the 'not in my name' opposition was never even discussed. There was no debate. Somewhere recently I posted the Scott Adams article about how Trump works but here it is again -http://uk.businessinsider.com/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-explains-trumps-persuasion-style-2017-10Focus as shown in this article on commercial aka social media manipulation whilst the antics of Trump and Blair are a background without any mention of that is just a joke Soros' article represents a smokescreen. While I agree that social media are a mural of idiocy, the real problem is the dire economic consequences of liberal trade and free capital flows. It is these which are causing the turn towards less liberal behaviors, simply because it is understood that once the nation-state is freed of the burden of depressing it's economy out of fear that benefits will be spent on imports (or make it's exports less competitive), then it will take care of it's citizens. Also, like others, I have to agree that Soros' applaud of the European Union (and the miserable Eurozone) are inexplicable. \"Freedom\" is great when it allows the Gated Community crowd to attack and destroy society, but \"freedom\" is bad when it enables the people to rebel. Soros has no use for freedom, much less democracy. His goal is anti-democratic neoliberalism, nothing more, nothing less. That's his idea of paradise for the sheltered elites. A grim world for everyone else. I tried to chat my answer to a new,social contact won on a social forum chat in USA.Here is the part of my message: \"...Holistic kind of Real Change- a new level of cultural evolution if gone thr.-publicly. Probably an kind of social-economic-political-cultural process which takes some generations. Power people find propably a suitable person as a public hero so such ..within their own network,thus controllable..Never mind,soul powers are working even behind- in spite of discrimination,blackmailing,marginalization and such.Good even to be an authentic man,not a historic puppy-dictator,living as a SocialSelf-focused personality,not as a soul-conscious individual. Good luck to your business xxxYour friend Lasse T L Uppsala,Sweden #uskottavuusloikka in Twitter with my native language,in Swedish and English too(translated in English: what is needed to make me trustworthy or step by step forward to the social status and getting through with my Real Change-message- difficult to translate word by word)\" I did't got through with my sending. Facebook answered that the link leaded to a third party website.I wonder if this was the whole content of motivation,as found that some of my F-comments were followed,or that some third party groups- using F-book, categorized my factual descriptions what had happened to me in my alternative thinker-career (read: non-career) when trying to develope my new paradigm of science or manydimensional view (theory) of Reality and Man. When they (that network defined my facta/experienced data based story-comment to another person's life-experiences as an immigrant from Latin America in Austria as spam,I answer with criticism of that and then shut of my contact with them. Thus,back to Soros and his criticism. Facebook and Google follow in their business the mostly the current values of their societies and current views of reality and man. I have yet found that they have not closed my alternative thinker stories or trying to make business about my alternative thinking,as nowadays science,media,political and cultural circles in Northern countries have been silent and totally tried to marginalize my effort to come through with my proposals and new theories to explain anomalous psi-data and other anomalous,empirical data questioning our current views of Space,Time and ourselves. Soros surely don´t know about my new value theory,with which I have made proposal for a new kind of economic theory which is different from current NeoClassical theory. Nor about my proposal for a new kind of \"relativized market-theory\"-maybe a new level of market- with the help of computerization.Thus as those \"basic organisations\" in science-world,other media,politics have already silenced the new message. Or my proposal/model/ for a new kind of project-payment form M.O. (Management Option) which can even be used as a threefold secure derivate instrument,and help social equality policies if used in public projects too. Then anather perspective: suppose that psi-forces and abilities are much better than those of computers and/or A I . Thus, if the computerized world becames hinder for global evolution,the intellectuals abandon internet,use more psi and personal meetings.Much depends how those,owning these big companies,see themselves as a human being: through the current view of Man through Personality criterias- social roles,statuses,wealth,ethnicity etc- or as a authentic Individuals- soul conscious beings who see other people valueable too,even if not as rich as they themselves. In my new,manydimensional view Mind-Soul entities are real and survive the death of physical body and reincarnate in new bodies,according to their mental-ethical evolution.In summary,I like Soros' writings as a good and interesting article,quite in the spirit of J.S.Mill and myself and hope good effects of this conversation too.Lasse T Lainephilosopher-social scientist,writer,entrepreneurUppsala,Sweden Mr Soros, I can't believe your article is decrying the very mechanisms through which you amassed your vast wealth, not least of all you trying to bankrupt the British people following the Black Wednesday collapse (read it if you missed it!) Much of what you argue against you, and people like you created it! Equally, your rabid defence of the EU is inexplicable - when many of the same dysfunctional issues are present in the EU: corruption; lying; false truths; deception; bullying and harassment etc this makes your blind support of the EU all the more puzzling??? Constitutions - the EU had a new Constitution which was renamed the Lisbon Treaty because the EU knew few if any Parliaments in the EU would pass it - the EU eradicated involvement by the people in the setting of their new European Constitution, it was made by appointees and steam rollered through Europe as a new Treaty when in fact it was a massive theft of national sovereignty. The Internet - you complain about the Internet, but actually this is the most free medium the peoples of the world have had for generations. In Germany newspapers refuse to carry anti EU messages or allow people to speak, in fact much of the EU media is owned and controlled by pro EU views, even the BBC was captured by the EU through funding grants and their dirty tricks department and rebuttal offices have been working overtime to savage the democratic decision of the UK to leave the failing bloc. The internet is probably the only place people can find others who are as concerned about the death of democracy as they are and are stile (for the time being) allowed to speak freely. Rich and successful people dominating the debate - I hope you are also including yourself Mr Soros, your unwelcome intereference in a democratic vote of the British people to leave the EU is a matter for us, not for you and certainly it is none of your business to try and turn a democratic vote or to give succour to those who would shun democracy. Please don't lecture us about people like Putin setting up Mafia States, the UK is one of the few countries where we can still think for ourselves and can see a danger coming when we see it, we saw that with the EUSSR! And sadly Mr Soros despite any good intentions you may have, all we can see (in you) is a very rich person, grown fat on the suffering of others telling us how our democracy should be run and that it should be run in a way that pleases you - if that is not terrifying I really don't know what is? The Brexit issue, is a well founded fear of being subsumed by an unaccountable European Superstate masquerading as a benign bridge to prosperity and co-operation. However, when you look closely, you can see it was created to fool and entrap Europe and for the people of Britain, who would NEVER have voted to throw their sovereignty away to a German dominated Europe, a process of stripping away our rights; freedoms; control and sovereignty over our country has been a dastardly act perpetrated by all the political elites against their peoples and aided and abetted by questionable powerful people such as yourself. One would like to imagine as you come to the end of your life how people will view your legacy Mr Soros? Have you helped to create employment in Africa? Have you sought to expose corruption and exploitation of the weak against the strong - or have you profited from the exploitation of others? And now lecture those you have stripped of their wealth that your way is the right way?? Apart from Bill Gates, there are very few extremely rich people I admire, being able to buy your view of the world is a whole different ball game to persuading people that you are right, and sadly Mr Soros, you and the EU because of the explotation; the lack of democracy and the lies are very wrong indeed. Let the British leave in peace and get on with their choice to leave the EU - if you care anything for freedom and democracy you surely can see that the EU is very very far from that with absolutely no chance of every changing. Why would oyu want to condemn millions to another authoritarian regime, having just thrown off the chains of Communism - I find your logic alarming. Oh dear!!! This coming from a \"subject\" of a Crown and once empire that has a long track record of breaking up anything that doesn't benefit its own interests... - India/Pakistan, China/Hong Kong, Israel/Palestine, Ireland North/Ireland South - and so forth. So, do not try to cover up the British historic lack of commitment to partnerships and the common good with a tailor-made and self-serving “freedom” excuse. England was never committed to the European Union… so much so that it never embraced the Euro and certainly it did nothing to make the European union better and feasible.Further, do not satanize others such as Mr. Soros in an attempt to justify your own country’s shortcomings and try to re-direct the attention to the messenger instead of the message.Mr. Soros is not my cup of tea and I am certainly critical of some of his business dealings as I am of the dealings and on going market manipulation of many mayor banks as well as government and official economic institutions.That though has no bearing on the quality and propriety of Mr. Soros analysis and the concepts expressed in his article.I think Mr. Soros analysis of the potential social and economic dangers of the current state of social media in most parts of the world is absolutely valid and even accurate. Further, I am deeply concerned with the uncertainties on the impact that the ever faster deployment of communications technology - we are months away from the deployment of 5G - as well as the roll out of AI will have in the evolution of social media as well as the life of people across the globe and hence on the social, economic and political fabric of the current human existence paradigm.My concern about Mr. Soros most valid comments has taken me to read again a book written in the 1940’s by a the Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset - “The Rebellion of the Masses” - in search of some light to try and figure out what to expect if social media sponsored “Ochlocracy” ends up displacing liberal democracy.I believe though that the impact of whatever social-media and technology sponsored new paradigm is forged, it will hit developed economies and countries harder than less developed societies. Initially under-developed societies might have some chance of fast adapting to the new paradigm because they come from further back. In the long run though I can not bring myself to even imagine what will happen but I am weary of the harsh and violent image of the future being sponsored by Hollywood’s futuristic films and of modern video games.I do not agree though with Mr. Soros proposed formula to avoid the risks that the current social media has brought on. I think it is too late to try and control this unexpected phenomenon that has already become sort of a “force of nature”. I believe we would be better off trying to figure out a way to adapt and guide it as opposed to stop it. My duty though is not figuring out what will developed societies do since they have great thinkers that I am sure are trying to figure this one out. My duty is with under-developed countries such as Peru, with a long and rich social history that dates back to 4500 year BC, to find a way, and more important, to create the conditions, that guarantee that it will continue to be socially and culturally relevant in the uncertain new paradigm to come.In short, my duty today is to answer the call in the Toyota television ad of the Winter Olympics... “START YOUR IMPOSSIBLE!”; which I am doing. Mr. Soros is an optimist. Every child owns a smartphone or can access one. Nobody has the attraction like the one a smartphone exert over a child. The mind develops through social interaction. Through the use of smartphones social interaction shrinks to zero. I do respect George Soros but, in this case ,really, he ought to know better. Would we blame the printing press for Der Sturmer? We are finding out all over again that the threat of fascism appears to be a constant of human condition. Homo (barely) Sapiens is a bundle of animalistic emotion with a thin veneer of reason wrapped around it. His societies can be ruled by reason or by emotion. The former is colloquially known as democracy, the latter is colloquially known as fascism. Alas, the rule by reason requires constant work and vigilance. When the vigilance slips, as it does periodically, rule by emotion rares its ugly head. There are many reasons for the current predicament. Sad to say, George Soros, or rather his chosen profession, is part of this reason. Generational forgetting is another. There were real, underlying social reasons for the rise of fascism in the interwar Europe. Printing press or the radio were not the leading causes, and neither is the internet the leading cause today. No single company controlled \"the printing press\" which is a MACHINE which took on myriad permutations and distributed through myriad companies used in myriad ways. He would love the multiplicity of the printing press. Now imagine a single company owned all printing presses, owned the technology of how to adapt and change and innovate on the original printing press. We'd still be using Guttenberg's original perhaps! FB, Google are MONOPOLIZING the printing press -- that is his point Also, the printing press monopoly's economic model was to sell books to people, not people to companies or governments. By washing their hands of responsibility for content (both incoming form an outgoing to companies), the social media companies are able to get away with selling people... which in other forms is mostly outlawed. Robert. You appear to see this as a power game where one lobby group is anesthetized by an opposing lobby group. That is not the way it works. A substantial voter bloc often have a predetermined position which is typically opposed by another substantial voter bloc. When neither bloc can dominate the outcome is determined by floating voters who are often bribed economically. Soros cannot change this, he has no economic input and his effort broadly falls under the propaganda banner. As far as Brexiteers go - the vote appears to be due to genuine economic disenfranchisement due to the collapse of trad industry and I very much doubt newspapers had much to do with it. Beneficiaries of the status quo voted Remain, losers voted Leave. Nothing Soros says will change that economic environment and critically hard core losers will not be bothered about general economic pain because they have nothing to lose. Rather than complaining about lobbyists you need to look hard at the long term policies that created localised industrial collapse without compensation. In particular you need, I suggest, to look at the Thatcher policy with N Sea Oil revenues which were used decade on decade to buy votes for short term political opportunity for Thatcher, in direct contrast to the policy in Norway where Oil revenues were used to build a sovereign fund whereby Norwegians are effectively individual millionaires through that fund. Europe is now facing its own industrial base collapse, other than Germany which is a beneficiary of euro imbalance. France and Italy both have recorded 10% deindustrialisation in the last decade. Greece is worse. Poland is an example of a beneficiary entirely due to EU handouts. I voted remain, but believe me Europe has its own storm coming because it does not have Oil revenues to buffer it like the UK did Either America will catch up to the Europeans on this issue, or they won't. And what will be the great harm if they don't? Extremely tiny numbers of people may purchase things they can't afford, while the vast majority will simply skip past the ads and infomercial style posts without stopping. Any of the negatives you mention would simply manifest themselves in other ways in those very same people in the absence of the internet and social media. The problem isn't the internet or social media, it's a lack of a proper education and self-esteem building in their younger years that would inoculate people from the traps of life -- of which, social media advertising is an infinitesimally small problem. Nevertheless, it serves to illustrate that education and building self-esteem in young minds is the best way to prevent every social ill. It is a \"Free World\", people can live on the top of the Hymalias, not read newspapers or utilise any of the social media tools and platforms. Or they can choose to stay up all night and tweet everybody and anybody. It is a matter of choice and \"self determination\". Can the author confirm with full confidence that none of his investments is associated directly or indirectly with any social media outlet? It isn't a free world and never has been. It is always about balance. By that I mean who holds the balance of power. The power I prefer is held by a plurality of many actors which should result in a benign application and more choice for those who are subjected to its influence. When power becomes concentrated, it presents ever greater threat and loss of choice to those subjected to it. As for donations to fight Brexit, more power to Mr. Soros' elbow. Power in Britain has too long been resident in right-wing nationalists who regard themselves as inherently superior and fund sneering newspapers to hoodwink the population by appealing to prejudice, to use their votes against their own interests. The same thing happens in the US. Mr. Soros can see the imbalance and has a track record of trying to improve the balance. Bless the man. Robert, the term \"Free World\" is clearly defined, and there are many sources that one can seek to obtain a clear definition of it. To simplify matters however, if it was not for the \"Free World\" neither you, nor I nor anybody else for this matter would have been able to communicate freely and more especially, Mr Soros or the Author would not have been able to publish this article or express their views on this or any other forum. Surely, you and Mr Soros are not trying to stop or to sanction freedom of expression, are you? M M it is indeed a 'free world' for a lot of the world. Chomsky has an interesting definition of freedom, basically it is freedom to comply with the controlled environment which is why the word is so popular and permitted. By extension I would suggest that is also why the word populist with its negative image is used and permitted, it certainly is not allowed to be used in the same way as the word freedom. As Orwell said - control of what word means is control of everything. Soros appears to be complaining that social media freedom is not his definition of freedom; yet at the same time he is openly funding a 500K media campaign against Brexit which is simply an attempt to control an environment. Its no different to the sort of commercial activity he is complaining about on the internet because the objective is influence - but in this case it is justified as a matter of freedom. It really comes back to what the word means. Orwell would be laughing I suspect MM No, it is Soros using freedom to subvert individual democratically enabled action which is exactly Chomsky's point - Freedom is strictly defined and limited by the elites and establishment - and not democracy. Soros is right that social media has its dangers. However social media also has its advantages precisely because it is immediate and difficult to control, even with AI censorship control is difficult simply because of the difficulty of controlling what a word means (Orwells hypothesis was the control of words to control language and control reality, but words morph continually). Although Soros claims to want democracy he wants his version of democracy which is fair enough as an individual but not as a funded lobbyist. However he is not alone in trying to influence, there are many agent provocateurs about. The principal of democracy is all are equal. Soros appears out of his depth in this arena and he doesnt help himself by the people he employs or funds because they just mirror which does not resolve his problem. He needs to sack them I have read 29 comments looking for \"Who else has been developing and pushing the way to revive politics?“ That insight, emerged a few week after my Medium response \"Politics is dead, long live politics!\" to umair haque’s story “How Democracy Dies.” Most philosophers in practice, for example, Zygmunt Bauman, Yanis Varoufakis, and recently Byung-Chul Han, have given great accounts that show politics is dead, but I am trying to find others than me that are trying to revive it. Politics of The Wealth of Nations is dead. To revive politics I adapted one of Victor Hugo’s quote as: “There is nothing so powerful as #TheWealthOfGlobalization whose time has come.” The Twitter’s hashtag is one of many knowledge flows that have been emerging through me. So to revive politics we need to help emerge #TheWealthOfGlobalization. Now, those knowledge flows that’s in line with your quotes “As Orwell said - control of what word means is control of everything” and “Orwells hypothesis was the control of words to control language and control reality, but words morph continually.” I have read most of what's written in Mr. Soros' artcle from the article ‘How George Soros Upstaged Donald Trump at Davos,’ by John Cassidy, The New Yorker, January 25, 2018.” Based on that article I wrote \"Based on the above, I wrote the Medium story “Making sure large high tech companies have visible #CharacterEthic #ProSystem CEOs.” Jose ABoth Orwell and Chomsky (a linguist) talk about the power of language and how words are used and abused. Chomsky is quite left wing. Orwell's writing is now from sometime ago but still remains fresh. Both raise as many questions as they answer. Politics is not dead, in the West it has become more bipolar due to inequality and restricted social mobility. The problem then is society has no central policy ground and an enormous amount of effort goes into defending a position or attacking a position eg US current domestic politics, UK also. The danger becomes that what is demanded is action, any action. Hence Brexit and Trump, and Le Pen. Le Pen is interesting because she lost due to selling fear - a negative, not hope - a positive. Brexit was marketed as hope, as was Trump. European politics is due to be interesting with 2 important democracies Germany and Italy having mish mash policies due to having coalitions. If Trump cannot deliver he will walk into trouble with voters and he is running out of time, it typically takes about 3 years for policy to deliver something on the ground. In the bipolar politics the floating voter is more important than ever before and fickle by definition Steve , with all sympathy for your effort to analyse politics: don't generalise the USA bipolarity to \"The west\" The USA has a horrible \"winner takes all\" voting system. Except the UK, European countries have multi-party systems. So their dynamics are different. keep that in mind. Ferdinand, Thanks. You are quite correct it was written with the US and UK in mind. Its always a problem with generalising and trying to send out a response quickly. The winner takes all system with two large parties leads to yo-yo administrations where the opposition waits for the incumbents to fall out of favour - primarily with the floating voter. You have the situation where it is not about winning, its about letting somebody else lose Words can be powerful. By saying “don't generalise the USA bipolarity to ‘The west’“ seems to me related to the assumption that globalization is a bad thing. Please consider a different understanding of win lose bipolarity. In my framework there is #DarkGlobalization and #BrightGlobalization, the former as a result of the #ComputingBigShift by remaining under #TheWealthOfNations and the latter as a result of the #ComputingBigShift by letting direct democracy politics help emerge #TheWealthOfGlobalization. Both the UK and USA voters without being aware of the #BrightGlobalization elected #DeGlobalization against the low trust #DarkGlobalization of Europe and Hillary Clinton representative democracy. Can I say that representative democracy politics was bipolar stable for quite some time with the left and the right under #TheWealthOfNations until the emergence of the #ComputingBigShift when it became increasingly bipolar unstable under the #DarkGlobalization? To end instability and dissolve bipolarity, we need the emergence of the win win #BrightGlobalization of #TheWealthOfGlobalization in order to be able to create what I coined as the #SystemicCivilization. Jose - 'bipolar stable' for food for thought I refer you to Chinese philosophy where the concept is stability does not exist other than a transition between growth or stagnation - or stagnation and growth. It is somewhat alarming because if it is a transition to look at the last state tells you where you might be heading You are right Steve from the pure sense of stability that doesn't exist. Social things move all the time. As can be seen in a graph of my March 2016 post \"Elections in USA, Germany, Spain, DR are under unstable equilibrium, as they were in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Spain,\" that now has four updates, stability for me is different. I see a ball moving back and forth to a center, like getting the left in power and maybe then the right in power. In instability I see a ball moving to one extreme position away from the center, like #Brexit, #Trump, and the no so talk about first round of the French election. I have a lot to say to respond what you wrote, but I will try to complement what I meant so that we get to the same page. My Medium response \"Politics is dead, long live politics!\" starts as follows: \"Synthesis: most believe politics — the rules of the game of government — will not change. But now, once in 500 years, the people must be prepared to change those rules that have become far away from reality.\" That response is a shortcut to my response that has the following introduction. \"Representative democracy is dead, long live representative democracy! This response to the story “How Democracy Dies: The Collapse of Trust and the Loss of Faith in Human Possibility,” written by umair haque can be said to have started with the following post at the end of July 2014...\" As you can see, Soros' says that \"The EU is better positioned, because it doesn’t have any platform giants of its own.“ Reframing that quote, today I wrote a tweet whose principal image says \"As the #EU doesn’t have yet platform giants of its own, Should it be a #SocialBusiness3DoC pioneer?“ Then amplifying what you said, I wrote a tweet without an image that says: \"Might #SocialBusiness3DoC of #TheWealthOfGlobalization help #CharacterEthic people avoid Orwell's 1984 #SocialMedia of #TheWealthOfNations' manipulation of reality by the manipulation of words, like independence, #IndustrialCivilization, that control #PersonalityEthic people?\" This comment is based on Peter Senge’s finding \"Structure influences behavior: different people in the same structure tend to produce qualitatively similar results.\" That’s the dead representative democracy politics is the result of the structure of #TheWealthOfNations that in the past decades induces wrong behavior. This is the time for global direct democracy #GlobalDebout politics to act to representative democracy revive politics. To do it, #CharacterEthic #GlobalDebout citizens must act on the Medium narrative \"Will #GlobalDebout (effective people) create the #SystemicCivilization?, whose summary says: \"this narrative is for citizens all over the world to follow Peter #Drucker’s suggestions about how to become effective individual and global citizens that avoid distractions.“ Steve absolutely right, freedom is great if Soros gets to be free, if like the UK we decide to use democracy to throw off the chains of the EU we are misguided and don't know what is good for us. Intelligent peoples with the facts in front of them can make that decision without the \"help\" of Soros manipulating the system. Yes, Christine. Freedom is great *if* it allows people get to be free (and I agree with you wholeheartedly on the democracy/Brexit issue) and freedom is great *when* people are allowed to earn money and enjoy the rewards thereof. I posit that when *if* and *when* doesn't happen, then it isn't freedom nor a democracy we're describing -- it's a kleptocracy or something worse -- and is such a person, organization, country or bloc worth saving? Even from themselves? Like you and many others, I find Soros' assertions to be hypocritical and self-serving -- or, rather more likely, the utterances of a person who doesn't yet see the whole picture for what it really is -- due to spending far too much time living a gilded life. The social media platforms in the west are fake public spaces, as they are owned by private compagnies, themselves getting their earnings from sellers, so essentially this platforms are shopping malls with social and cultural activities and gathering spaces sponsored by the ads paying sellers. The fake news avalanche is essentially surfing on the waves of the fake needs that the sellers try to generate, but fake news might be effective echos of real cultural needs, that can't be fulfilled by the fake needs department. So apparently real goods are fulfilling fake needs, while fake news are fulfilling real neads of e.g. freedom of thought or freedom from usurpatory political power. I keep thinking of this excerpt from Lyotard's (controversial) Postmodern Condition: \"a person is always located at ‘nodal points’ of specific communication circuits, however tiny these may be.\" While not prepared to claim that postmodernism is a fertile subject, or as worthy as Mill, the above piece on social media might be described as discursive. Social media can be detrimental, and avoidable, but the point of the piece does not seem to involve things such as a postmodern cacophony when order is needed--or an \"Opium for the masses?\" Societies could benefit from regulation of monopoly media entities; perhaps it would be a sort of 'redistribution' of power to the populace. So, whether participation on such platforms is perhaps consistent with postmodernism asserting itself could be a weaker viewpoint. However, if you would like access to The Postmodern Condition in its entirety, you might need to have the resources of the Project-Syndicate contributor above. Everyone must know of Mill--even if no one goes to a bookstore to obtain his work anymore. Narcissism and low self esteem are both linked and displayed on social media, its got nothing to do with nodal points in communication, its behavioural with an overlay of automated conditioning by software.

Cambridge Analytica is the linchpin of the entire conspiracy. It's terrifying: \"There are three strands to this story. How the foundations of an authoritarian surveillance state are being laid in the US. How British democracy was subverted through a covert, far-reaching plan of coordination enabled by a US billionaire. And how we are in the midst of a massive land grab for power by billionaires via our data. Data which is being silently amassed, harvested and stored. Whoever owns this data owns the future.\" \"Last month, Facebookâs UK director of policy, Simon Milner, told British MPs on a select committee inquiry into fake news, chaired by Conservative MP Damian Collins, that Cambridge Analytica did not have Facebook data. The official Hansard extract reads: Christian Matheson (MP for Chester): âHave you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?â Simon Milner: âNo.â Matheson: âBut they do hold a large chunk of Facebookâs user data, donât they?â Milner: âNo. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.â And yet they did. He was lying through his teeth.Â It's an amazing story, scarcely credible but entirely true. One last time - if you don't pay for a service, then YOU and YOUR DATA are the product being sold. If you swap out \"Trump\" for \"Clinton\", we'd still have the same issues with Facebook. Correct? If Clinton's campaign had paid an outside expert team for this sort of service, I wouldn't expect her to know the details of their methods. It is like when a famous brand discovers 5yrs later that their clothing was made in a sweatshop somewhere in Asia. When they learn about it, they can take action. Prior to that...what can they do?

I suspect we're eventually going to learn that the Trump campaign directed the fraudulent obtainment of American citizens' private information and that it used this information for political purposes. In addition, I believe we're also going to learn that a good deal of this information was shopped to Russian intelligence for electioneering as well. Whether or not the latter point (Russian coordination) is ever borne out, the Cambridge Analytica scandal alone is enough to potentially be the worst presidential scandal in our nation's history. Mar. 18 11:46 am JST is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups. Mercer was a major funder of both Trump and Breitbart News, and was crucial in getting master propagandists S. Bannon and K. Conway into the inner circle of the Trump campaign (and subsequent administration) and its psychological warfare operation against objective facts. So, yeah, this doesn't exactly surprise me. It's all part and parcel of an orchestrated attack on political stability and reasoned discourse, a goal that has served both Trump and Putin very well. Mar. 18 11:52 am JST Mar. 18 12:22 pm JST Never download apps on Facebook. They almost always contain a disclaimer allowing them to suck up your profile in its entirety. Stick with chatting with your friends scattered around the globe and sharing photos of your dog and you're fine. And don't overshare with Facebook - if they ask you a seemingly innocuous question such as your favorite food, ignore it.

In addition, I believe we're also going to learn that a good deal of this information was shopped to Russian intelligence for electioneering as well. We should just start using Trump's methods, and stop saying 'I suspect that eventually...' and 'I believe we're going to learn...', and just start stating it as if it were fact. The people are obviously too stupid to fact check it, so let's feed them fake facts. Trump's campaign directed the fraudulent obtainment of American citizen's private information, and they shipped it to the Russian intelligence. Fact. Pure and simple fact.

Mar. 18 03:35 pm JST I use Facebook to market my business. Its free and it works The end. I pity the fools that spend their lives on there posting about their insignificant lives. Nobody should be surprised it is a force for evil. Even its' creator has abject contempt for the users. And I don't blame him. Mar. 18 09:39 pm JST Facebook on Friday said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica after finding data privacy policies had been violated. So in other words Facebook gave the company access to its user data. They sell user data for a profit - not shared with the users. When it becomes public Facebook turns around and points the finger at the people they are taking money from. Mar. 18 09:45 pm JST This is an impressively convoluted way of saying, \"It's not Trump's fault and Hillary is just as bad, even though she didn't actually do anything.\" Well Hillary did pay the Russians for opposition research on Trump for the 2016 election. The same Russians that purchased Facebook ads to spread dissension among Americans before and after election day.

Same as Twitter, instagram etc. just speak to the local people in person and as I canât vote, do the odd anti-nuke gig. last time I was in Manila, guesthouse residents spent 80% of their time on Facebook etc. 20% in the Irish bar 2 blocks away.

He was hired after Hillary signed on with Fusion. This is a well known fact. Mar. 19 04:48 am JST @Super: Trump had a Twitter meltdown this morning. Good stuff. Yes, very good stuff. Loved how he slammed the FBIâs corruption and the partisan makeup of Muellers team of Democrat donors/ investigators. McCabe was accused of lying under oath about his authorization of press leaks during an ongoing investigation. McCabe is lucky because as a law enforcement officer he may only lose his pension. Flynn may lose his freedom for the exact same offense. Hope the inspector generals report leads to a serious housecleaning of the politicized leadership in the Hoover building. Mar. 19 05:23 am JST What makes you think it's politicized? Is it because Comey helped Trump days before the election? What concers me if that you have Republicans investigating Republicans. Mueller and Rosenstein could easily be working together to make sure Trump walks. They are lifelong members of the Republican Party and as such they will be biased in favor of Republicans. Or so I'm told that's how it works when the investigators are Democrats. It will be a while before we can validate the IG's report. We need to go through his history, especially texts and social media, to make sure he has never said anything critical of Clinton. If he has, then obviously we need to set aside any conclusions he makes if it goes against those investigating Clinton. From there we will need to make sure there are an equal number of Democrats and Republicans on the team, and then we need to make sure none of them have ever had an opinion of any politician involved in the investigation. Then we move on to their spouses and other family members. If any of them have ties to a politician that's either Republican or Democrat then again, we might have to invalidate the findings. Them, when all of that is done, let me know and I'll take a look at the findings. Mar. 19 09:10 pm JST I donât know where you get your news but the unknown sponsor of the GOP opposition research with Fusion GPS did not involve ex-foreign spy Steele - the author of the dossier. He was hired after Hillary signed on with Fusion. This is a well known fact. The sponsor is not unknown, the sponsor was started by the Republicans: As previously reported by multiple news outlets, Fusion GPS was hired first in the fall of 2015 by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website funded in part by New York hedge fund operator Paul Singer to look into various Republican presidential candidates, including Trump. It has already been reported that the Free Beacon called off Fusion GPS in May 2016 as Trump was clinching the nomination, before Steele was hired by the firm,Â according to the Free Beacon. The Washington Post reported in October that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Committee then paid Fusion via a law firm for its work on the dossier."}

Cambridge Analytica is a right-leaning, U.K.-based company that once boasted Steve Bannon as a vice-president. It aims to help political parties target voters with tailored messaging, based on information gleaned from a variety of sources. A pair of bombshell articles hit on the weekendâone from the Observer and the other from the New York Timesâalleging that Cambridge Analytica surreptitiously acquired data on 50 million Facebook users. The data was apparently collected through a personality-test Facebook app that was devised by a University of Cambridge academic called Aleksandr Kogan, with Wylie’s help. The Observer described Wylie as a Cambridge Analytica employee at the time the data was taken, in 2014, although the company asserts he was a contractor. Either way, he says he helped build Cambridge Analytica’s “psychological warfare” tool. As Wylie notes there, Facebook stands accused of knowing for two years that Cambridge Analytica had broken its rulesâand quite possibly some lawsâbut did not inform its users that their personal data had been taken. Facebook told CBS News that “Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account.” “Given he said he ‘exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,’ we cannot do this at this time,” the company said. Whether or not Facebook was justified in suspending Wylie’s accounts, to do so now is not a good look. Cadwalladr said on Twitter that banning the whistleblower was an “unconscionable” move on Facebook’s part. Back in 2014, it was possible for the maker of a third-party Facebook app to get their hands on the details of the friends of all those people who voluntarily used the appâas happened with Kogan’s personality test, where only 320,000 people actually used it. However, Facebook removed that capability not long after. According to Wylie, Facebook allowed Kogan to take all of this data at the time because he claimed it was for academic use. Kogan is a faculty member at both the University of Cambridge and St Petersburg University. Cambridge Analytics denies still having the data he took, and also denies that it was used in the company’s work for Donald Trump’s campaign ahead of the 2016 election. This article was updated to note WhatsApp’s denial that it suspended Wylie’s account.

(Image: Sinclair Broadcast Group) WASHINGTON (SBG) â A number of Facebook users are changing their status with the social media giant from \"It's Complicated\" to \"Separated\" after learning the company mishandled user data and shared it with third-party developers. For any public company, trust is its currency. The latest revelations of a massive user privacy breach at Facebook have raised new questions about whether the company can and should be trusted to responsibly manage the personal data of its more than 2.1 billion users. #DeleteFacebook began trending last week after reports that Facebook allowed the data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly access the personal data of as many as 50 million users. According to admissions by Cambridge Analytica, the data was used to develop psychographic profiles to help political campaigns target voters. In the aftermath of these revelations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone on a charm offensive, speaking with reporters, apologizing for mishandling user data and promising to do better in the future. On Sunday, Zuckerberg took out a full-page ad in multiple U.S. newspapers that read, \"We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't we don't deserve it.\" The ad referred to the Cambridge Analytica operation and the actions of a \"university researcher,\" Aleksandr Kogan, who developed a quiz app in 2014 on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Under Facebook's policy at the time, Kogan was able to pay for a feature called \"friends permission.\" That allowed him to harvest the data of 270,000 quiz-takers, who gave explicit consent to use their data, as well as the data that could be gleaned from their friend networks. In his ad, Zuckerberg admitted that Kogan's app was not the only one that trawled large amounts of user information. \"We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,\" Zuckerberg said. He concluded, \"Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.\" Some have taken note of the CEO's apology and applauded the company for taking steps to make its data-sharing policies more transparent. Zuckerberg and other executives at Facebook have published notices explaining steps they're taking to crack down on platform abuses as well as their efforts to make privacy settings more user-friendly. Others have pointed to the fact that Facebook's business model is based on monetizing user data. \"Facebook says we don't sell your data, but they certainly provide access to it,\" observed Michelle De Mooy, director of the privacy and data project at the Center for Democracy and Technology. Moreover, Facebook acknowledged that it knew about Cambridge Analytica's questionable contract with Kogan in 2015. At that time, they suspended Kogan and asked him to confirm that he had deleted the user data. According to reports, that user data remained accessible to Cambridge Analytica for years. \"Facebook has been dragged, seemingly kicking and screaming into being more transparent,\" said Dave Levine, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford University. \"Facebook has not done nearly as much as it could, simply by way of explanation to the public about its behaviors, about how your information or posts are curated, about what kind of data it collects and how it shares it.\" The Cambridge Analytica breach is only the latest example of the company's opacity and delayed response to public outcry. Facebook has been at the center of the fake news controversy and spreading misinformation during the 2016 election. The company has been called before Congress over their role in facilitating Russian election interference and online terrorist recruitment. And the company finally acknowledged and changed their newsfeed policy after being caught suppressing conservative content. Each scandal has temporarily hurt Facebook, but the latest scandal over violating users' privacy could be the one that tips the scales and imposes real costs and consequences on the social media giant. \"Ultimately the problem here is one of trust,\" explained Julian Sanchez, privacy and technology fellow at the Cato Institute. If users no longer believe the company is responsibly handling their information or feel they cannot understand the company's policies for sharing their data, Zuckerberg's apologies will be \"too little, too late,\" Sanchez noted. \"Once that's burned, once people don't have a sense of trust, I don't know if the specific policy changes will help much,\" he continued. \"Even if they really are making genuine improvements, as it appears they are, once that trust is gone, it's hard to get back.\" In a new poll conducted in the days after the data sharing scandal erupted, Reuters/Ipsos found that the majority of respondents do not trust Facebook to handle their data. Facebook was deemed the least trustworthy when it came to obeying laws that protect American's personal information when compared to other companies that gather user data like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Yahoo. \"Maybe the poll is new, but the sentiment is not,\" De Mooy explained. The reason, she said, is that social media platforms \"are designed for opacity,\" intentionally making it harder for users to understand and make informed decisions about their data. Facebook and other companies that rely on selling access to user data have had to walk a thin line between protecting their users' data and monetizing it. Consistently over recent years, polls have shown that even as users sign up and sign away some of the rights to their data, they are wary of how that information is being used. Periodically, this concern has translated into relatively short-lived calls for people to deactivate their Facebook accounts, but it is not clear that those efforts have caused the company to fundamentally change how it operates. \"If a few hundred-thousand people delete their Facebook accounts that will have a marginal impact on their bottom line,\" Levine noted. \"However if there is a reputational hit at the trust level, which is what Facebook needs to maintain in order to be a viable business, that cumulatively could create problems.\" In recent weeks, Facebook has taken a significant hit with the markets valuing the breach of privacy and trust in the tens of billions. Since the story broke earlier this month, Facebook's stock has plunged more than 15 percent in a selling spree that has cost the company over $75 billion in market value. Facebook could also be facing even more costs as the consumer protection watchdogs at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced on Monday that they had opened a non-public investigation into Facebook's privacy and data use policies based on the reports about the company's relationship with Cambridge Analytica. The FTC already brought charges against Facebook in 2011 for what it termed \"deceptive privacy claims.\" At the time, Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC and signed a consent decree which, among other things, required the company to obtain a user's explicit consent before allowing third parties to access their data. Moreover, the agreement required Facebook to inform users if they discovered they were unable to protect their data. \"Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here,\" former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Jessica Rich told the Washington Post last week. \"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties.\" If the FTC finds Facebook in violation of the consent decree, the company could face a $40,000 fine per violation. It is not clear whether that fine would apply to the alleged 50 million users whose data was shared inappropriately with Cambridge Analytica. In a statement to the Post, a Facebook spokesperson said the company rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\" De Mooy said she is encouraged by the FTC investigation, emphasizing that \"the consent decrees need to be meaningful.\" However, she worries that regulators simply lack the enforcement authority when it comes to protecting consumer data. In the United States, consumer data is largely governed by contracts and terms of use agreements between the consumer and the company. This approach is vastly different from the European Union, which will be implementing a new regime of privacy protections, the General Data Protection Regulation, beginning in May. The new privacy regime will directly impact U.S. tech companies that will be required to be more transparent in informing consumers about their sharing practices in order to get consent. Companies that fail to protect user data can also expect to see millions of dollars in fines. It is yet to be seen whether U.S. lawmakers, who have traditionally taken a lax approach to regulating internet companies, will take steps to strengthen data privacy protections."}

Getty Images Facebook said late Friday that a data analytics firm affiliated with Donald Trump's presidential campaign has been suspended from its service, following allegations the firm mishandled data obtained from hundreds of thousands of users. The social networking giant said it learned several days ago that Cambridge Analytica, a firm that among other things helps target political messages to people online, had misused data about Facebook users. The information, such as cities users said they lived in, content they liked, and information about their friends, was collected from an app called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" made by Aleksandr Kogan, a lecturer at the University of Cambridge. Facebook said that in 2015, when it first learned users' data had been passed to other companies, such as Cambridge Analytica, it demanded that those companies certify the data had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica is accused of having lied. \"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,\" Paul Grewal, a VP and general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.\" The late-evening announcement points to another example of questionable online behavior tied to the 2016 US presidential election. We've already learned that automated bot programs and operatives working on behalf of the Russian government appear to have manipulated Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and other social networks as part of a broad misinformation campaign that's now being investigated by both the FBI and the US Senate. Though investigators have been focused on Russia, they've also turned attention to Trump's presidential campaign, which had hired Cambridge Analytica to run data operations. Late last year, The Wall Street Journal reported the firm was asked to hand over documents to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team, which is investigating election meddling. Now Facebook says it's received claims Cambridge Analytica misused data about more than a quarter million users. \"We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information,\" Facebook said, adding that it now reviews apps to ensure they don't violate its policies. \"We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\" Neither Cambridge Analytica, Kogan nor The White House responded to requests for comment. Now playing:Watch this: Did Facebook lose control of your information? 3:28 On Saturday morning, Cambridge Analytica said in a tweet that it \"fully complies with Facebook's terms of service\" and that it doesn't \"hold or use any data\" from Facebook profiles. It also pointed to a statement about the issue on its website. Among other things, the statement says Cambridge Analytica deleted the data in question and that the firm \"only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly.\" It also says the company's data protection policies \"comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations.\" Cambridge Analytica said it's in contact with Facebook \"to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\""}

A two-year long PR crisis has come to a head, and Facebook is facing some serious backlash. So the question is, how can Facebook win back the hearts -- and more importantly the trust -- of millions? As it stands right now, Facebook staunchly believes itself to be a platform -- but what it really needs to be is a brand. Brands fight for our business, and they do so by fighting for our attention. And as a result, brands have personality. Brands make us love them. And that’s the action Zuckerberg needs to take. Think about the companies we all love: Apple, Amazon, Tesla. These brands have purpose, they have meaning -- they have created relationships with their consumers. And that relationship is what keeps the public loyal, even in the face of a communications hiccup. (And yes, we are all aware that playing a questionable role in a major election is more than a hiccup … but still.) Apple is an omnipresent brand, but it is by no means a perfect brand. It's publicly confirmed it slows down batteries of older models. Yet here we are, still carrying our iPhones, looking for chargers. Because at this point, going non-Apple just really isn’t an option. That’s the beauty of “brand.” It breeds loyalty. It has longevity. It attracts love. Brands tell a story. They make the consumer feel things. They forge a personal connection. But, Facebook has always focused on the service, not on the emotion. And yes, its product is functional, but that doesn’t mean it has to eschew the connection. No service is more functional than Amazon, but its brand is full of connection. Just look at its Super Bowl commercials. They were fun, heartwarming, engaging -- and they were also a great PR effort for Jeff Bezos. The ads humanize a utilitarian brand, creating affinity and loyalty among consumers. Steve Jobs was the inspirational, intelligent and beloved CEO who made it seem that, more than anything, he cared about moving society forward. Apple’s goal was making your life better, easier, more efficient, more fun -- and consumers loved that idea. Once Jobs was gone, Elon Musk wanted to take on this role. And through tireless efforts, he’s successfully filled those grey New Balance sneakers. Zuckerberg, on the other hand, hasn’t tried to enter this space. And now, it’s biting him in the you-know-where. Tesla and SpaceX have had plenty of production issues. Potential bad press follows Musk around like a bad boyfriend, but we still love him and his companies. And that’s because he’s able to create a narrative of innovation and inspiration that consumers and investors are always willing to stand behind. He mystifies them. He charms them. He makes them fall in love with him. He's got a bit of a P.T. Barnum effect, actually. And that’s what Zuckerberg is missing. Facebook is at a pivotal point in its history. Currently, if we’re talking about its relationship status with the public, “it’s complicated.” But, with the right personification and branding, it can get back in the public’s good graces despite the information crisis, and people will keep sending \"friend requests\" and tagging photos. Just like people keep buying iPhones. So, what needs to change? Right now, Facebook’s brand communications are entirely transactional. Zuckerberg tells us what is happening but not why it’s happening. And as a result, people view the brand from a place of utility. Nobody loves Facebook; they just use Facebook. It’s a product, not a brand. And if the platform is going to survive this PR nightmare, it needs people to feel a legitimate and emotional connection to it. It can’t just count on consumers using Facebook because it’s convenient; they need people to love using Facebook. Facebook needs to take its consumers on a journey, one that paints an inspirational and powerful vision of the future. It needs to create a narrative that makes Facebook an integral part of a better tomorrow. It needs to feel helpful, but human. It needs a brand story. It needs a bit of Barnum. And it shouldn’t be hard to do! Facebook -- as a platform, as a brand, as whatever you want it to be -- is already about “making the world a better place by connecting people.” That’s a powerful message that consumers can get behind. But now, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica crisis, we’re seeing what happens when the world doesn’t get better by connecting people. And since Facebook hasn’t spent time telling us a powerful narrative about the good side of connecting people, we’re primed to believe and to become easily swayed by the bad side. It’s time for Facebook to realize that it is a brand. And then, for it to begin acting as such. It needs to invest time and effort into making people love them. It’s time for Facebook to change the narrative and turn its story into something positive. If Zuckerberg wants to save his company, he needs to strike an emotional chord. He needs to earn his consumers' trust. He needs to create a future-looking brand story, one that makes Facebook feel important and inspirational -- and imperative. He needs to take us back to 2008, when we were all constantly changing our profile pictures and friending everyone we met. Back to poke wars and 60-photo albums, and afternoons spent writing on people’s walls. He needs to make us fall in love with Facebook all over again.

Not really Your personal information is Facebook's currency. It's bought and sold every day. Posted: Mon 5:41 PM, Mar 19, 2018 Your personal information is Facebook's currency. It's bought and sold every day. When advertisers want to target a specific group of customers who, for example, are a particular age and have a certain political affiliation or interest, Facebook makes that possible. The stuff you share and the inferences Facebook makes about you are packaged together with similar people's data, stripped of names and sold to companies. That allows businesses to put ads in front of people they're certain they can influence. On Facebook, you are the product. Advertisers are the customer. Facebook's not alone. Most advertiser-supported networks sell some of your information to third parties. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL, Amazon, Twitter and Yelp do the same. Related: What You need to know about Facebook's data debacle Giving up our privacy is the price we pay for getting to use Facebook for free. Most of the time, that tradeoff works: People take advantage of free services by posting, searching and sharing. Most companies that collect our data use it for legitimate purposes and within the bounds that companies like Facebook permit. That arrangement has turned Facebook and Google into online advertising juggernauts. They have built massive audiences of billions of customers, and advertisers flock to them. Facebook and Google control three-quarters of the $83 billion digital advertising market in the United States, according to eMarketer. But the customer-is-the-product deal doesn't always work to the user's advantage. This weekend, the public learned data company Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed 50 million Facebook users' personal information to influence the 2016 election. Internet companies have a financial disincentive to give users more control over their data. If people share less, social networks will earn less money. Most companies offer privacy settings, and some even let you leave and take your data with you. But they don't make it easy, and critics say social networks and internet companies should give users far more say about which data ends up in advertisers' hands -- and when. \"Tech companies can and should do more to protect users, including giving users far more control over what data is collected and how that data is used,\" said the Electronic Freedom Foundation in a statement. \"That starts with meaningful transparency.\" Once you share something on any digital service, your personal information leaves your control. Cambridge Analytica serves as a stark reminder of that. Related: Why nobody can tell Mark Zuckerberg what to do The data company broke Facebook's rules when it obtained the data from a researcher without users' authorization. That's the tricky thing with data: Once it's out there, it's hard to out boundaries around it. Facebook trusts companies and researchers who obtain your data to use it properly. If they break the rules, Facebook can punish them (it suspended Cambridge Analytica, for example), but only after your data has already been used illicitly. \"It's difficult to police after it's left your secure perimeter,\" said Rik Ferguson, vice president of security research at Trend Micro. \"Cambridge took advantage of the porousness of Facebook.\" Online Public Information File Viewers with disabilities can get assistance accessing this station's FCC Public Inspection File by contacting the station with the information listed below.

Facebook said it learned in 2015 that University of Cambridge researcher Aleksandr Kogan violated its privacy policy by passing data from a mobile app called \"thisisyourdigitallife.\" Wired senior reporter Issie Lapowsky said on CBSN \"A lot of the spotlight is going to be on Cambridge Analytica because it seems like they were being a little deceitful here, but I think we have to look equally critically at Facebook,\" Lapowsky said. \"This is just emblematic of such a crucial underlying issue with Facebook: they've created this incredibly powerful data operation and sell really robust data to their clients but they have very few mechanisms in place to ensure people aren't going to abuse that data.\" Lapowsky said about 270,000 users signed up for the app, allowing Kogan to offer this data and pass it to Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL). \"Facebook had a loophole at the time where app developers could not only see the data of the people who actually proactively downloaded the app, but they could also see into their entire friend network,\" said Lapowsky. \"You start out with 270,000 people but you fan out to 50 million,\" Lapowsky said. \"About 30 million had enough information that Cambridge could develop what they call their 'psychographic' profiles.\" The profiles allow firms to predict the voting likelihoods of individual people based on personality -- and Facebook is a treasure trove for this information. How 50 million profiles were harvested from Facebook Sources close to the company told Lapowsky that some of the Facebook user data was visible to a select few employees within Cambridge as recently as 2017. \"One has to wonder why this change is coming in 2018 when we know that Facebook was first alerted to this in 2015,\" she said. The Guardian reporter Carole Cadwalladr told CBSN that Facebook threatened to sue in a bid to prevent the news outlet from publishing an exposé on the data harvesting. She believes Facebook didn't inform users of the misuse of data because it wasn't in the company's best interest. The Guardian story, based on interviews with whistleblower Chris Wylie who worked for the firm, published online on Saturday. Cambridge Analytica was hired by President Trump's 2016 campaign. Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign digital guru, Brad Parscale, told \"60 Minutes\" last year that they didn't use the controversial \"psychographic\" practice because it \"doesn't work.\" This site uses cookies, tokens, and other third party scripts to recognize visitors of our sites and services, remember your settings and privacy choices, and — depending on your settings and privacy choices — enable us and some key partners to collect information about you so that we can improve our services and deliver relevant ads.

The social network announced the suspension of Cambridge Analytica on Friday, saying it received reports that the company had not deleted data it received from an app developer, despite saying it had done so. On Saturday, the New York Times and the Guardian published joint reports alleging Facebook's statement only came after reporters with the newspapers inquired about Cambridge Analytica possessing â and still possessing â data from as many as 50 million users. \"During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control,\" the New York Times report read. \"But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.\" The data was given to Cambridge Analytica by Aleksandr Kogan, a professor at Cambridge University, who legitimately gained access to Facebook users' personal data, but then broke the rules by passing it along to a third party. At the time in 2015, Facebook said it removed Kogan's app and demanded certifications from him and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica and Kogan, as well as a third vendor, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, all certified that they had destroyed the data, Facebook said. The suspension Friday was put in place to investigate the claims to the contrary, Facebook said. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,\" Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a statement. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made.\" An account apparently belonging to Wylie, who was extensively quoted in the reports, later announced on Twitter that he too had been suspended from Facebook. In a statement, Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, wrote, \"Mr. Wylie has refused to cooperate with us until we lift the suspension on his account. Given he said he 'exploited Facebook to harvest millions of peopleâs profiles,' we cannot do this at this time.\" Damian Collins, the chair of Britain's House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said he would be calling on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before it â and would be recalling Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz's campaign in 2015, then for Trump in 2016. The company says it uses a method called \"psychographic\" profiling to understand behavior, and the company's CEO has boasted that it \"profiled the personality of every adult in the United States of America â 220 million people.\" It insists it played an instrumental role Trump's ultimately successful bid for the presidency. The company also has deep ties to Trump-connected figures. Former senior White House counsel Steve Bannon served on Cambridge Analytica's board of directors, and the firm is largely owned by the Mercer family, one of Trump's biggest donors. Facebook's suspension of Cambridge Analytica comes on the same day David Carroll, a professor at New Yorkâs Parsons School of Design, filed a legal claim in the UK against the company for its use of his personal data. Carroll has been digging into the company's practices since early 2017 in an effort to understand what data it has and how it was obtained. The suspension also comes as Facebook grapples with how to handle the dissemination of news, as well as the spread of misinformation, on its platform. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted Saturday that her office had launched an investigation into Cambridge Analytica."}

But what really needs to be considered when exploring a solution? What questions need to be asked? Download to find out... The ICO said on Wednesday that it has completed its investigation, into whether WhatsApp could legally share users' data with Facebook in the manner the firm was considering. The short answer? No. \"WhatsApp has not identified a lawful basis of processing for any such sharing of personal data\", information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said, adding that \"if they had shared the data, they would have been in contravention of the first and second data protection principles of the Data Protection Act.\" The ICO said WhatsApp had \"failed to provide adequate fair processing information to users in relation to any such sharing of personal data\", adding that the sharing of such data \"would involve the processing of personal data for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose for which such data was obtained\". WhatsApp has agreed to sign an undertaking not to share personal data with Facebook (unless this data related to support services) until they can do so in compliance with the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force in May this year. \"I reached the conclusion that an undertaking was the most effective regulatory tool for me to use, given the circumstances of the case,\" Denham said. WhatsApp said in a statement given to INQ: \"WhatsApp cares deeply about the privacy of our users. We collect very little data and every message is end-to-end encrypted. As we've repeatedly made clear for the last year we are not sharing data in the ways that the UK Information Commissioner has said she is concerned about anywhere in Europe.\" As WhatsApp has agreed not to share data with Facebook, for now at least, the firm has not incurred a financial penalty. \"I compliment WhatsApp in signing this undertaking, which I believe will build trust amongst their many UK users,\" added Denham.\"I would also like to stress that signing an undertaking is not the end of story and I will closely monitor WhatsApp's adherence to it.\" µ"}

(Jenny Kane/Associated Press) Facebook's CEO apologized for the Cambridge Analytica scandal with ads in multiple U.S. and British newspapers Sunday, saying the social media platform doesn't deserve to hold personal information if it can't protect it. The ads signed by Mark Zuckerberg said a quiz app built by a Cambridge University researcher leaked Facebook data of millions of people four years ago. \"This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again,\" the ads said. Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm affiliated with U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, got data inappropriately. The firm is alleged to have created psychological profiles to influence how people vote or even think about politics and society. Facebook's stock value has dropped more than $70 billion since the revelations were first published. Among the newspapers with the ads were The New York Times and The Washington Post in the U.S. and The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph in the United Kingdom. The ads said Facebook is limiting the data appsÂ users receive when theyÂ sign in. It's also investigating every app that had access to large amounts of data. \"We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected,\" the ads stated. Zuckerberg closed the ads by saying: \"I promise to do better for you.\" Cambridge Analytica got the data from a researcher who paid 270,000 Facebook users to complete a psychological profile quiz back in 2014. But the quiz gathered information on their friends as well, bringing the total number of people affected to about 50 million. The Trump campaign paid the firm $6 million during the 2016 election, although it has since distanced itself from Cambridge."}

A whistleblower has revealed to the Observer how Cambridge Analytica â a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trumpâs key adviser Steve Bannon â used personal information taken without authorisation in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements. Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: âWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of peopleâs profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.â Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. The New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data. The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use. However, the app also collected the information of the test-takersâ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebookâs âplatform policyâ allowed only collection of friendsâ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebookâs role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate âinformation warfareâ against the US. Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissionerâs Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum. âWe are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,â said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. âItâs part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing peopleâs personal information to micro-target voters.â On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebookâs external lawyers warned the Observer it was making âfalse and defamatoryâ allegations, and reserved Facebookâs legal position. The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. âResidents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,â she said on Twitter. The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. âThis story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether itâs allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, itâs clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,â he said. Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data. Simon Milner, Facebookâs UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: âThey may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.â Cambridge Analyticaâs chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: âWe do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.â Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agencyâs cybercrime unit and the Information Commissionerâs Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles â mostly belonging to registered US voters â were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower. At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014. The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebookâs own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles. That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him. âBecause this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,â the letter said. Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said. âThat to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.â Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: âFacebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and itâs failed in its duties to respect the law. âIt has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasnât. Itâs failed time and time again to be open and transparent.â A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan âgained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channelsâ but âdid not subsequently abide by our rulesâ because he passed the information on to third parties. Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. âWe are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,â Paul Grewal, Facebookâs vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted. Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the companyâs terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a âclose working relationshipâ with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps. The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour. The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate. âThe ultimate product of the training set is creating a âgold standardâ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,â the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million âmatchedâ profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further. At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firmâs data had come from GSR, Nix said: âWe had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.â Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not. GSR was âled by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Electionsâ, a company spokesman said. SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been âknowingly breachedâ and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election. Steve Bannonâs lawyer said he had no comment because his client âknows nothing about the claims being assertedâ. He added: âThe first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.â He directed inquires to Nix."}

But investors then jumped into the fray, pushing Facebook shares higher the rest of the day â to close at $160.06, up 67 cents. âThe FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook,â the statement said. âToday, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.â In 2011, Facebook signed a consent decree with the FTC that restricted the ways the company could share usersâ personal data. The decree was reached after the agency accused the social network of deceiving its users âby telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,â the FTC said at the time. Among other things, Facebook had told users that third-party apps on its site wouldnât be able to access their data, and pledged to inform users if their data was ever shared. Nevertheless, the apps got access to almost all of their personal information, according to the FTC. Facebook agreed to a $40,000 penalty for each future violation. The social network also found itself fighting off accusations of invading usersâ privacy in other ways. Users who checked data on them gathered by Facebook found that the company had years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths and text messages. Facebook defended itself, pointing out that users were taken to a page that explicitly asks if they would like to enable the feature which would âcontinuously upload info about your contacts like phone numbers and nicknames, and your call and text history.â Reports of the data collection came as Zuckerberg took out ads in multiple US and British Sunday newspapers to apologize for the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The social media platformâs stock value has dropped over $70 billion since the revelations were first published."}

U.S. technology stocks lagged broader markets, continuing a sell-off sparked by reports of large-scale misuse of Facebook user data. Facebook Inc (FB.O) shares lost 2.5 percent, continuing a slide that took nearly 7 percent off their price on Monday. While stocks on Wall Street climbed, Facebook’s drop kept the gains in check. There were other tech-related problems, as well. An accident with an Uber test car UBER.UL on Monday that resulted in the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle also weighed on Silicon Valley sentiment. “There certainly are some stocks where valuations look somewhat stretched... so we’re focusing our exposure within the technology sector on the cheaper end of the market,” said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “We’re a bit more cautious on the more expensive and some of the more popular names in the sector,” he added. FOCUS ON THE DOLLAR The U.S. dollar climbed to a one-week high against the Japanese yen as traders limbered up for the start of a two-day Fed Reserve meeting. Slideshow (3 Images) With a quarter-point hike - its sixth since the Fed began raising interest rates in late 2015 - baked into market prices, major currencies were largely moving in ranges. “Euro/dollar is being buffeted by cross currents, especially as both central banks (Fed and the ECB) are normalizing policy, but it needs an unexpected policy action to jolt markets,” said Neil Jones, Mizuho’s London head of currency hedge fund sales. Markets expect at least two more U.S. rate hikes after Wednesday this year, although analysts acknowledged that the central bank’s ‘dot plot’ could potentially point to as many as four. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was up at almost 2.89 percent US10YT=RR, 6 basis points below the four-year high of 2.957 percent touched a month ago. Two-year notes US2YT=RR hit a 9-1/2-year high of 2.33 percent. Among major commodities, oil prices jumped in line with the dollar as investors remained wary of growing crude supply, although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran provided some support. [O/R] U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 2.24 percent to $63.52 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $67.37, up 2 percent. The potential for a trade war cast a shadow over export currencies after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminum. The government is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday. U.S. businesses were alarmed, with several large U.S. retail companies, including Wal-Mart Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), on Monday urging Trump not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China. The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.74 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.75 percent to $1.2241. The Japanese yen weakened 0.42 percent versus the greenback to 106.54 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was at $1.3996, down 0.19 percent on the day."}

It would “look bad” for him to leave, the sources said. We’ve asked Facebook for comment and will let you know if it can confirm or deny the move. If accurate, the departure reveals high-level tension at Facebook over its approach to Russian meddling and other misinformation campaigns — it shows that some executives might not have wanted to verify the extent of the campaigns or notify users to the degree it has so far. The news certainly comes at a bad time, following right after word that Cambridge Analytica had collected the data of 50 million Facebook users without consent (and that Facebook may have sat on its knowledge of this since 2015). If Facebook really did time Stamos’ exit to minimize uproar, it’s having the opposite effect. Update: In a Twitter post, Stamos confirmed that his “role did change,” but that he’s also still “fully engaged” with work at Facebook. He didn’t definitively say whether or not he was leaving, however."}

On the other, I could see plainly how the data was being collected, packaged, and then sold to advertisers so that they could more effectively influence people, and this made me feel very uneasy. I should say right now that I donât feel that advertising is evil, nor do I think that tech companies are evil, nor do I hate capitalism. I also am not a journalist, so donât expect some fancy data and graphs to back up my feelings here. Everything here is anecdotal, but I would like to feel that I know what Iâm talking about having worked in ad sales and partnerships at Google, Twitter, Vine and Medium going back to 2003. What I believe is that 2016 was a watershed yearâââthe year we saw how the data footprint that we leave behind can be used against us. What is coming out now about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica is a reckoning. Weâre seeing how easily we can be manipulated when the most intimate details for our livesâââour private thoughts, our feelings, and our desiresâââare known to companies and used without our explicit knowledge. I hope this is the year that we start to draw harder boundaries, so we can prevent all of this from getting worse. In the words of the great songwriter Aimee Mann: itâs not going to stop until you wise up. Back in 2008 I was working for Google. Iâd been with the company from the infancy of CPC AdWords, through the purchase of YouTube, to the burgeoning threat of Facebook. And I was at a company summit in NYC to discuss the new world of social media and what it would mean for advertising. We brought in a speaker who was one of the largest AdSense advertisers on YouTube, MySpace (!), and Facebook (back before FB had their own ad platform, app devs could run their own ads on app canvas pages). With smug confidence, this advertiser (who was a young man in his early 20s) told us how easily he could peddle diet patches to young women, and what data points he used to target them. He was very eager to tell us all how much money he made on a daily basis. I was horrified. And enraged. I could easily see where this was headed, and strangely, my dystopian fantasy looked something like where we are today, with an electorate subtly manipulated to believe that electing a reality TV star for president was a good idea. (Sometimes Iâm glad David Foster Wallace isnât alive right now because he would have throw up his hands and been like, yep, I canât write anything more fucked up than this.) I impulsively stormed out of the summit and wrote âIf you donât want to be evil, donât be greedyâ on a hallway whiteboard and left the building. A month later, I left the company. I was worried that Google was becoming too powerful, and I also was interested in social media, which I could see the company didnât understand at that time. I had set my sights on a small but quickly growing social network named Friendfeed, which was created by a group of ex-Google product managers and engineers. And I loved it. It had everything: a vibrant group of technologists who loved sharing interesting ideas and information, a real-time news feed with social feedback (they invented âlikingâ), multi-platform aggregation, media uploadingâ¦the list goes on. It was the social platform that Google should have built. Friendfeed was the next big thing. It was the future. I flew out to Mountain View twice and begged the founders to hire me. But they didnât have use for my skill set at the timeâââno need for people with an ad sales backgroundâââbut I still was an active member of the community and kept my eye on them constantly, hoping there would be an opportunity to work with them. But then in August of 2009, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook bought Friendfeed, which really, really, really pissed me off. I knew then that there was no way Friendfeed was going to stay an independent platform. Its technology would be absorbed, and our small Friendfeed community would disperse. And thatâs exactly what happened. Friendfeed became the Facebook News Feed that we all know and love today. And like a black hole, Facebook continued its strategic land grab of start-ups and technology companies. My attention turned to Twitter, which I didnât like nearly as much as Friendfeed. It was really difficult to get anyone to engage with you on Twitter unless you already had a large following or were famous in IRL, which is still a problem that Twitter has never really solved. I think it accounts, in part, for the tradition of trolling and abuse on the platformâââone easy and quick way you can get people to pay attention to you is to be as outrageously awful as possible, and you may at least get a defensive response from someone, finally. Infamy will alway trump the shame of invisibility, I guess! In 2010 I joined Twitter after Dick Costolo became CEO. I had a lot of respect for Dick after working briefly with him at Google. He had headed up Feedburner, which Google had acquired in 2007. I had felt that Feedburnerâs ad model had brought an important piece of the social media puzzle to Google (which they squandered), and if Dick was joining Twitter, things there probably werenât going to go badly. I also was a fan of Blogger and Ev Williamsâ thoughtful approach to technology. When Twitter launched its ads business, I threw myself behind the success of the company and its advertising because I didnât want the company to fall in the gigantic shadow of Facebook and be absorbed like Friendfeed. The technology industry, more so than any other industry, needs viable competitors, and it made me nervous to see Facebook alone in its category, with Google still lagging behind on the social front. The early years selling ads for Twitter were painful. For one, we werenât Facebook. We didnât have nearly the scale of Facebook, and our ad targeting capabilities were pathetic compared to Facebookâs. I canât tell you how many advertisers would say to us, âWell, on Facebook I can target by gender, age, income, relationship status, zip code, number of household childrenâ¦â which was hard to counter when our only unique value proposition was buying a trending hashtag that didnât even include geotargeting. As the ad business matured at Twitter, it was a constant push and pull for the company, trying to reach some parity with Facebookâs targeting and size while still maintaining user privacy, which was something the executives truly cared about and strongly advocated for, to the chagrin of the ad sales team that kept losing big buys to Facebook. Twitterâs ad platform now is light years more advanced than the one I used when I left the company in 2015, but itâs still having to carve out its business from the scraps of Google and Facebook. Itâs really, really, really hard to compete against Facebookâs ad platform, guys. Not only is everyone and their mom on Facebook, but the depth and breadth of the data people give to Facebook properties is mind-boggling. Couple that with off-site data (Catalina, Comscore, etc) they cross reference with their own first-party data, and you have basically enough reference points to create complete psychological profiles of the majority of people on the planet. And in order to even attempt to be competitive, new companies that try to sell ads on their content are pressured to compile and sell as much user data as they can. I saw this first-hand at Medium, where I worked briefly in 2016 trying to help build their ad platform to support independent writers and publications. Although I wasnât privy to any high-level conversations the decision-makers had at Medium, I can imagine that after our sales team demonstrated to Ev what data Medium would need to be give away in order to be remotely competitive with Facebook, he was like, âFuck this shit,â and fired us all. Which is what ended up happening. And while it sucked to get laid off, I was neither surprised nor angry, and I respected him for trying again to make subscriptions work. Hereâs the whole point to me telling you all this self-indulgent personal history about working at tech companies: whatâs going on right now with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica is very serious and very important, and my hope is that our legislators understand its gravity and come together to figure out reasonable boundaries and exclosures for data collection and sales before it gets even worse. Market pressure for exponential revenue growth is too draconian for the industry to curb itselfâââthere will always be an appetite for more and more data to collect and sell, and there will always be nefarious players who will use it for destructive ends."}

On Monday, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said: âWe entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called âhoney-trapsâ for any purpose whatsoever.â But that's not exactly what Cambridge Analytica executives said on camera: Send in the girls One of the most stunning revelations by Nix was his willingness to use sex workers to gather dirt on a clientsâ opponents, and use the information to discredit them online. When asked about digging up material on political opponents, Nix said they could âsend some girls around to the candidateâs house, we have lots of history of thingsâ adding that Ukrainian girls âare very beautiful, I find that works very well.â Nix suggests that it would be better not to use Sri Lankan girls in the operation, but bring Ukranian girls with them. âI mean it was just an idea, Iâm just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know, you know what Iâm saying,â he said. Blackmail Another possibility suggested by Nix involves setting a victim up and leveraging the incriminating evidence to remove an opponent from the campaign. âWeâll offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance, weâll have the whole thing recorded, weâll blank out the face of our guy and we post it on the internet,\" he said. In an ironic twist Nix even suggests that one of the most effective ways of undermining your enemies is to secretly film them admitting to corruption. â[What is] equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal thatâs too good to be true, and make sure that thatâs video recorded, you know, these sorts of tactics are very effective instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.â âWe just put information into the bloodstream of the internet, and then, and then watch it growâ Offering bribes to public officials is an offense under both the U.K. Bribery Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Cambridge Analytica operates in the U.K. and is registered in the U.S. Bloodstream of the internet While the practices Nix describes are relatively crude in their approach, the company also offered much more subtle approaches, which left no trace but were just as effective. Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analyticaâs political division told the reporter \"we just put information into the bloodstream of the internet, and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again â¦ like a remote control.â Turnbull added that this âhas to happen without anyone thinking, âthatâs propagandaâ because the moment you think âthatâs propaganda,â the next question is, âwhoâs put that out?ââ He later adds: âSo we have to be very subtle, and weâve got time to do this.â Shadow operations Despite being widely known about, the reach of Cambridge Analyticaâs operations were not fully understood until now, given that they boast of impacting more than 200 elections around the world. The reason is that the company uses an extensive range of tactics to hide their fingerprints on any operation they conduct. âSo often we set up, if we are working then we can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists, there are so many options we can look at. I have lots of experience in this,â Nix said. Turnbull added at a separate meeting that operations are run âso that no record exists with our name attached to this at all, and I think we can work in that space as well.â Intelligence gathering When the reporter asks if Cambridge Analytica offers intelligence gathering services, Turnbull says the company has âpartnerships with specialist organizations that do that kind of, that do that kind of work. So that, you can, you know who the opposition is, you know their secrets, you know their tactics.â At another meeting, Turnbull says the people who they work with at ex-MI5 operatives who work with âprivate organizations whose job is to gather research. âThey will find all the skeletons in his closet quietly, discreetly, and give you a report,â he said. Contradiction Turnbull appears to have contradicted himself about the scope of the operation Cambridge Analytica offers to their clients. In a December meeting with the reporter, Turnbull says: âSo weâre not in the business of fake news, weâre not in the business of lying, making stuff up, and weâre not in the business of entrapment, so we wouldnât, we wouldnât send a pretty girl out to seduce a politician and then film them in their bedroom and then release the film. There are companies that do this but to me that crosses a line.â Yet a month later he was present when Nix laid out the possibility of using prostitutes to entrap local officials as well as offering bribe. In the January meeting he proclaims: âIâm a master of disguiseâ when referring to the possibility of having someone pose as a wealthy developer.

The move came as U.S. and European lawmakers demanded an explanation of how the consulting firm, which worked on President Donald Trumpâs election campaign, gained access to the data. In the U.S., members of Congress called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about Facebookâs actions. Facebook said on Monday it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analytica still had the data. âAuditors from Stroz Friedberg were on site at Cambridge Analyticaâs London office this evening,â the company said in a statement late Monday. âAt the request of the UK Information Commissionerâs Office, which has announced it is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation, the Stroz Friedberg auditors stood down.â Facebook shares closed down nearly 7.0 per cent on Monday, wiping nearly $40 billion off its market value as investors worried that new legislation could damage the companyâs advertising business. âThe lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook data practices, and the picture is not pretty,â said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valleyâs use of data. Also on Monday, a source said that Facebook head of security, Alex Stamos, plans to leave the company over disagreements about the companyâs policies on misinformation. He had been a strong advocate for an aggressive approach to alleged Russian activity on the platform aimed at manipulating elections. His departure was first reported by the New York Times. Facebook declined immediate comment. In a tweet, Stamos did not deny he was leaving but said: âDespite the rumors, Iâm still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. Itâs true that my role did change.â The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebookâs reputation, which is already under attack over Russiaâs alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election. London-based Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denied the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules. However, further allegations about the firmâs tactics were reported late Monday by British broadcaster Channel 4 which said it secretly taped interviews with senior Cambridge Analytica executives in which they boasted of their ability to sway elections in countries around the world with digital manipulation and traditional political trickery. Cambridge Analytica rejected the allegations, saying in a statement that the Channel 4 report âis edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.â Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from the U.S. Congress after the reports in the New York Times and Londonâs Observer over the weekend. Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Widen sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties. Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers. Facebook and other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Incâs YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled. Late on Monday, the Connecticut Attorney General said the office will initiate an inquiry into Facebook data policies. The Senate was expected to move forward on Monday with a bill that would chip away at the internet industryâs legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking.

Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica, a data-analysis firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, over allegations that it held onto improperly obtained user data after telling Facebook it had deleted the information. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) Facebook is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million users to try to influence elections. NEW YORK (AP) â Facebook “likes” can tell a lot about a person. Maybe even enough to fuel a voter-manipulation effort like the one a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm stands accused of â and which Facebook may have enabled. The social network is under fire after The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that former Trump campaign consultant Cambridge Analytica used data, including user likes, inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections. Monday was a wild roller coaster ride for Facebook, whose shares plunged 7 percent in its worst one-day decline since 2014. Officials in the EU and the U.S. sought answers, while Britain’s information commissioner said she will seek a warrant to access Cambridge Analytica’s servers because the British firm had been “uncooperative” in her investigation. The first casualty of that investigation was an audit of Cambridge that Facebook had announced earlier in the day; the company said it “stood down” that effort at the request of British officials. Adding to the turmoil, the New York Times reported that Facebook security chief Alex Stamos will step down by August following clashes over how aggressively Facebook should address its role in spreading disinformation. In a tweet , Stamos said he’s still fully engaged at Facebook but that his role has changed. It would have been quieter had Facebook likes not turned out to be so revealing. Researchers in a 2013 study found that likes on hobbies, interests and other attributes can predict personal attributes such as sexual orientation and political affiliation. Computers analyze such data to look for patterns that might not be obvious, such as a link between a preference for curly fries and higher intelligence. Chris Wylie, a Cambridge co-founder who left in 2014, said the firm used such techniques to learn about individuals and create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. In doing so, he said, the firm “took fake news to the next level.” “This is based on an idea called ‘informational dominance,’ which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what’s actually happening,” Wylie said Monday on NBC’s “Today.” It’s not yet clear exactly how the firm might have attempted to do that. Late Friday, Facebook said Cambridge improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded an app described as a personality test. Those people agreed to share data with the app for research â not for political targeting. And the data included who their Facebook friends were and what they liked â even though those friends hadn’t downloaded the app or given explicit consent. Cambridge got limited information on the friends, but machines can use detailed answers from smaller groups to make good inferences on the rest, said Kenneth Sanford of the data science company Dataiku. Cambridge was backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon â later President Donald Trump’s campaign chairman and White House adviser â as a vice president. The Trump campaign paid Cambridge roughly $6 million according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work. The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person’s viewing behaviors fit with what other customers watch. But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it’s connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media. Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” He said the firm “works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.” Wylie told “Today” that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge effort aimed to make sure people wouldn’t know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views. The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge’s data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn’t retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn’t use it in its 2016 campaign work. Yet Cambridge boasted of its work after another client, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, won the Iowa caucus in 2016. Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz from similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use. Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights, Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it could push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might have described keeping guns for protection against crime. It’s possible that Cambridge tapped other data sources, including what Cruz’s campaign app collected. Nix said during the Cruz campaign that it had five or six sources of data on each voter. Facebook declined to provide officials for interview and didn’t immediately respond to requests for information beyond its statements Friday and Monday. Cambridge also didn’t immediately respond to emailed questions. Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook’s mapping of the “social graph” â essentially the web of people’s real-life connections â is also invaluable for marketers. For example, researchers can look at people’s clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting. Two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center. While people don’t exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the “rabbit hole” of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described. ___ An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the sum paid by the 2016 Trump campaign to Cambridge Analytica. It was $5.9 million according to federal election records."}

NEW DELHI: The government has sent a notice to Facebook, asking it provide details by April 7 regarding possible data breach and manipulation of Indian electoral process by the social media giant or its associates. The notice to Facebook comes days after the IT Ministry asked its associate and London-based vendor Cambridge Analytica a host of questions over similar allegations, that included misusing the data of Indian users to influence and \"manipulate\" elections. \"It is felt that there is need for further information about the data breach from Facebook. Accordingly, a letter has been issued by the IT Ministry to Facebook,\" the government said, spelling out areas where details have been sought. The Ministry has asked the Mark Zuckerberg-founded American tech giant whether the personal data of Indian voters and users had been compromised by Cambridge Analytica or any other \"downstream entity\" in any manner, and if so, how was it compromised? Amid probe by US privacy watchdog and British lawmakers over a potential breach of user confidentiality by Facebook, IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Indian government fully supports freedom of press, speech and expression and is all for free exchange of ideas on social media. Another question asked is \"whether Facebook or its related or downstream agencies utilising Facebookâs data have previously been engaged by any entities to manipulate the Indian electoral process?\" The government has also asked Facebook about the measures it undertakes to protect the data of users. \"What are the specific steps proposed to be taken by Facebook to prevent any misuse of personal data for potential interference in, or manipulation of the Indian electoral process?\" Also, the Ministry asked whether Facebook has taken any \"proactive measures\" to ensure the safety, security and privacy of such large user data and to prevent its misuse by any third party. The notice to Facebook and its associates comes as the political slugfest between the BJP and the Congress over misuse and manipulation of user data has been intensifying. While accusing the Congress party of engaging with data companies to influence voters, the BJP-led NDA government has said that the âfairness of Indian democracy and electoral process is a matter of pride and any attempt to influence the sanctity of the electoral franchise through dubious and questionable means is unacceptable.â IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had earlier asked Zuckerberg and other social media companies to refrain from acting in a manner that manipulates user information to subvert electoral process. \"Mr Mark Zuckerberg you better note the observation of the IT Minister of India. We welcome the FB profile in India, but if any data theft of Indians is done through the collusion of FB system, it shall not be tolerated. We have got stringent power in the IT Act, we shall use it, including summoning you in India,\" Prasad had warned the FB founder last week.

Speaking at the inaugural Hello Etsy conference in Berlin, the author of Program or Be Programmed said: \"Ask a kid what Facebook is for and they'll answer 'it's there to help me make friends'. Facebook's boardroom isn't talking about how to make Johnny more friends. It's talking about how to monetise Johnnny's social graph.\" Advertisement He added: \"Ask yourself who is paying for Facebook. Usually the people who are paying are the customers. Advertisers are the ones who are paying. If you don't know who the customer of the product you are using is, you don't know what the product is for. We are not the customers of Facebook, we are the product. Facebook is selling us to advertisers.\" Rushkoff believes that this lack of understanding is a construct of software companies who don't want you to understand their inner workings. He explained that in the early 1990s, to use a computer was the same thing as to program a computer. He explained: \"It took anywhere from a few hours to a day to learn how to use a computer back then, but then you knew the whole thing. You were using the computer. You weren't dependent on boxes of software you bought off the shelf, you were making that world as you went along. There was no such things as an 'end user', just a 'user'. We were all equals.\" However, he explained, companies realised it was hard to make money out of people who communicated with each other through interfaces that they made themselves. So they created more of a distance between the programmer and the user, building packages of software that were easy-to-use but removed the end user from being able to appreciate the baises embedded within them. \"I'm not asking you to know how your computer works and how to change the power supply or solder,\" he said. \"I'm asking that you understand the language, the interface, the software that the computer is using. You don't want your kids to be James Joyce, you just want them to learn how to write. If you are not prepared to program then you are being programmed.\" \"It's not the difference between being a driver and a mechanic, I'm talking about the difference between being a driver and a passenger. If you depend on a driver like in Driving Miss Daisy, you'd better trust Morgan Freeman.\" He said. Advertisement One of the barriers to understanding is a reticence among some programmers to reveal their processes. \"I'd love everyone to document their code on their website, explaining how it works and why they made this or that decision.\" He proposes that we create interfaces that encourage programming literacy rather than protecting proprietary software. I guess he hasn't heard about initiatives such as Codeacademy? How do you see your relationship with Facebook? Do you realise you are being 'sold' to advertisers? Or are you just like poor little Johnny?"}

Facebook can continue to deliver their service to you and send you advertising. The difference is that it will be much harder for Facebook to use your activity collected off Facebook to send you ads and other targeted messages [emphasis added].\" Mozilla introduced the container concept to mainstream Firefox users in September when it rolled out \"Firefox Multi-Account Containers,\" a company-made add-on. In a way somewhat similar to how Firefox - and other browsers - isolate one tab from others to block app- or system-wide exploits, these containers insulate cookies generated by one site from those produced by other websites. (Normally, all cookies are stored in one memory location by the browser; Mozilla's extension sets up multiple \"cookie jars,\" or storage locations, and thus prevents one site from recognizing and reading cookies recorded by other URLs.) \"If used carefully, Containers can prevent tracking. If a site is only opened in one Container, cookies set on that container cannot follow the user to other sites visited in non-container tabs or other containers,\" Mozilla stated in a backgrounder about the technology. Facebook Container is, at root, a customized version of the earlier add-on, as Mozilla explained in another, albeit unsigned, blog post Tuesday. \"When you install this extension, it will delete your Facebook cookies and log you out of Facebook,\" the company noted. \"The next time you visit Facebook it will open in a new blue-colored browser tab (aka 'container tab'). In that tab you can login to Facebook and use it like you normally would. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\" Mozilla Facebook Container signals it's active by shading the name of the service, as well as drawing a thin blue line under the tab. Facebook has been under renewed scrutiny because of allegations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, illegally collected and retained the data of more than 50 million Facebook users. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has launched an investigation into Facebook's practices, and Zuckerberg will answer questions from at least one congressional committee, according to the New York Times But while Mozilla capitalized on the turn against Facebook among some users - evidence highlighted by the #deletefacebook campaign - it admitted that the Container add-on would not have helped in the latest instance. \"The type of data in the recent Cambridge Analytica incident would not have been prevented by Facebook Container,\" acknowledged Mozilla's Nguyen. \"But troves of data are being collected on your behavior on the Internet, and so giving users a choice to limit what they share in a way that is under their control is important.\" Elsewhere, Mozilla pointed out the downsides of adding Facebook Container to Firefox. Among the issues with Facebook: Users may not be able to log in to other sites or accounts with their Facebook credentials, and \"Like\" buttons offered by non-Facebook websites will not work. The Facebook Container can be downloaded and installed into Firefox from this page of the Firefox Add-ons market. Mozilla has long touted its browser as the best choice for the privacy minded, with the pitch's credibility dependent, at least in part, on the fact that unlike Google (and its Chrome), Mozilla's business model does not directly rely on monetizing user data via targeted ads. (Mozilla certainly indirectly leans on just that; the bulk of its revenue comes from setting Google as Firefox's default search engine.) The open-source developer repeated the privacy talking points as it rolled out Facebook Container. \"This add-on offers a solution that doesn't tell users to simply stop using a service that they get value from,\" Nguyen said. \"Instead, it gives users tools that help them protect themselves from the unexpected side effects of their usage.\" Copyright 2018 IDG Communications.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2 Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still donât know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we wonât until Facebook comes clean and notifies users. Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach. Cambridge Analyticaâs CEO called the data the âsecret sauceâ that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics â including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5 For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the companyâs poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebookâs settlement.6 Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are â or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data. We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone â including the Trump campaign â who might potentially use this data from Facebookâs platform."}

Such a violation, if eventually confirmed by the Federal Trade Commission, could lead to many millions of dollars in fines against Facebook, said David Vladeck, who as the director of the FTCâs Bureau of Consumer Protection oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the subsequent consent decree resolving the case in 2011. He left that position in 2012. On Sunday morning, Vladeck said in an interview with The Washington Post that Facebookâs sharing of data with Cambridge Analytica âraises serious questions about compliance with the FTC consent decree.â He added, âI would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to.â The FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday morning. Facebook has denied violating the consent decree when it allowed an app developer working for Cambridge Analytica to gain access to information about an estimated tens of millions of people. The group included both the 270,000 Facebook users who downloaded a psychological testing appÂ and the Facebook âfriendsâ of those people. This included the preferences those friends had expressed by hitting the widely used âlikeâ button on social media posts or news stories. In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, âWe reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.â Vladeck, now a professor at Georgetown Law, said violations of the consent decree could carry a penalty of $40,000 per violation, meaning that if news reports that the data of 50 million people were shared proves true, the companyâs possible exposure runs into the trillions of dollars. Vladeck said that such a fine is unlikely but that the final penalty still could be very large. âThatâs the maximum exposure, though itâs not clear to me that the agency would insist on that kind of a penalty,â he said. The FTC issue is rising as lawmakers in both the United States and Britain call for answers from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook â in some cases demanding that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg personally appear at legislative hearings. The FTC consent decree required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app sought permission from those who downloaded it but not their Facebook friends. The app, called âthisisyourdigitallife,â offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as âa research app used by psychologists.â A key question now is what was allowed under Facebookâs privacy settings at the time, and whether those permissions were so broad as to allow routine violations of the 2011 FTC consent decree. Hundreds of developers -- including those who made popular dating and gaming apps and those who built political apps for campaigns -- used Facebook to gain access to huge amounts of information about users and their Facebook friends. Data that could be easily accessed from friends included names of users, their education and work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. The data collected by the app reportedly was shared with Cambridge Analytica and used to help the firm build profiles of individual voters and their political preferences to better target advertising to them. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing or improperly acquiring Facebook data. Such collection techniques were within the bounds of Facebook's data-handling policy at the time, the company has said, but later were severely restricted through policy changes in 2014 and 2015. Vladeck's view was echoed by another former official who also was closely involved with the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was then the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program, led the investigation into Facebook before the 2011 consent decree. She said in an email to The Post on Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, âbespeaks the same recklessness with its usersâ data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.â Rich said the consent decree specifically prohibited deceptive statements, required users to affirmatively agree to the sharing of their data with outside parties and required that FacebookÂ report any âunauthorized access to dataâ to the FTC. âDepending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties. They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws,â wrote Rich, who is vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports. âFacebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.â Facebook said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to understand what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica. âWe are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information,â said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel in the statement. Before the 2011 consent decree, Facebook had been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center had urged the FTC to investigate the company on grounds that it had deceived consumers, changing the way it handled usersâ sensitive information with little warning. The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as usersâ friend lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those usersâ permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raisedÂ other issues about apps on Facebook, which regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate. As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumersâ consent before âenacting changes that override their privacy practices,â the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement. Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action from consumer advocates, who sayÂ the FTCÂ is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps. âThis is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commissionâs failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,â said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. âThe United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC canât do the job.â Some privacy advocates previously faulted the FTC for its response to a 2014 incidentÂ in whichÂ Facebook, which also owns the messaging app WhatsApp, began combining user data across its services after initially promising that it would keep them separate. The incident later drew a formal investigation and fine from the European Union, which charged that Facebook had made misleading statements about its plans and practices. The FTC, for its part, only issued the company a warning letter â and it never appeared to take additional action.

Some users were shocked by what they discovered. As pointed out by Ars Technica, the social networking site has been logging years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths, and text messages from those who use Android devices. Facebook responded to the findings Sunday, stating all the aforementioned data was collected to improve its friend recommendation algorithm and had only collected the information from users who opt-in to allow it. Android users are asked to share the data after they install Facebook Messenger and Facebook Lite. “The most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with,” a Facebook spokesperson told Ars. “So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts.” \"OMAGAD, Facebook has been leeching all my SMS/calls/contacts from my phone!\" Seriously, do you ever check apps requiring abusive permissions before installing them or think why such permissions are needed? I kicked the FB app ages ago because of exactly that. Facebook also claimed that it does not record call or text conversations, nor does it sell the collected data. At this time, it doesn’t appear that iPhone users have been affected. POST CONTINUES BELOW Though Android users are presented with an opt-in screen upon downloading the apps, the message doesn’t specific what kind of data is being collected; it simply reads: “this lets friends find each other on Facebook and helps us create a better experience for everyone.” In an effort to increase transparency, Facebook published a “fact check” blog post Sunday in which they attempted to explain the call and SMS logs. They also provided instructions on how to enable the feature. “For Messenger, you can either turn it on, choose ‘learn more’ or ‘not now’. On Facebook Lite, the options are to turn it on or ‘skip’,” Facebook wrote. “If you chose to turn this feature on, we will begin to continuously log this information, which can be downloaded at any time using the Download Your Information tool.” Needless to say, things aren’t looking too good for the website right now. Just last week, Facebook and its co-founder Mark Zuckerberg faced severe backlash after it was reported that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, had gained access to personal information on more than 50 million Facebook users.

But this goes much deeper than that. Facebookâs 2.2bn active users might well wonder, how safe is their personal data? And is Facebook doing enough to secure it? And why did Facebook only react on Friday, when it must have known there was a potential problem many months, if not years, ago. In August 2016, it sent a legal letter to Christopher Wylie, a former Cambridge Analytica employee, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been improperly collected. Play Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer Facebook did not publicly disclose this at the time, and appears to have carried out no further enforcement other than requiring those who wrongly held the data to âself-certifyâ that they had indeed destroyed it. It was only last week, four days after the Observer asked Facebook about the improper transfer of data, that the company moved to suspend Cambridge Analytica from its platform. More troubling still is the apparent lack of any systematic response to ensure the same type of breach does not happen again. Facebook has strong technical oversight of how and why third parties can access user data on the platform. But what can it do to stop this information being shared? A company could legitimately collect Facebook data for one purpose before being bought by another firm, which uses the information for entirely different ends. Given the vast scale of the Facebook ecosystem, it seems likely that other firms could have inherited data. Facebook may also find its users asking uncomfortable questions about the social networkâs own use of data. When the company talks to politicians, it makes a big deal out of its ability to accurately profile voters using the information they give to the site. Facebook can, it tells those seeking election, separate out the users âwho are actively engaged with public political content and have a high propensity to re-share contentâ. It has boasted about how effective its own political advertising wing has been. Facebook was âintegralâ to the 2015 presidential election victory of Polandâs Andrzej Duda, the company claimed. It has cited the Scottish National partyâs âpowerful combination of Facebookâs targeting and engagement toolsâ as being responsible for its âoverwhelming victoryâ in the 2015 general election. The language, and the claims, are very similar to those used by entities such as Cambridge Analytica."}

Free labor is Facebook's lifeblood Cambridge Analytica may have been the straw that broke the camel's back for Facebook users. Image: bob al-greene/mashable By Casey Williams2018-03-26 16:47:32 UTC Chances are, you work for Facebook.Â You probably don't have an office or an ID card. And you almost certainly don't get paid. But if you're one of the 239 million Americans who use the platform each month, your work is as valuable as a coder's. Maybe more. Your clicks, likes, and posts keep content circulating, users scrolling, and data streaming into algorithms used to serve you ads. Leave, and the platform crumbles. You do two jobs for Facebook. You generate data and produce content. Facebook is essentially an advertising company, and every bit of information you disclose is data advertisers can use to influence how and what you buy. Sometimes it's fairly benign (maybe you do want that Blue Apron subscription). Other times it's not. Data is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to shape your behavior, and as Cambridge Analytica shows, it can be dangerous.Â Your job is to drive people to the platform and keep them thereÂ You also create most of what's on Facebook. You write posts, share photos, and capture live video of speeches, protests, and police shootings. The time and effort you sink into crafting a poetic confession, an impassioned rant, a thoughtful reflection on the day's news â think of it as work you do for Facebook. You're working to keep the site humming and vibrant, and you're creating reasons for others to keep scrolling. Your job is to drive people to the platform and keep them there.Â And you spend a lot of time doing it. In 2016, users spent an average of 50 minutes a day using Facebook products, including Instagram and Messenger. That number has declined recently, but let's say you spend, say, 35 minutes a day on the site. That's 26 eight-hour days a year â \"more than any other leisure activity surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the exception of watching television programs and movies,\" according to the New York Times. \"It's more time than people spend reading (19 minutes); participating in sports or exercise (17 minutes); or social events (four minutes).\"Â Time Well Spent? Leisure is labor on Facebook. People use the app voluntarily, and yet, as more and more social activities relocate to the internet, it's increasingly work people feel they have to do to live meaningful, connected lives. Facebook is a News Feed, photo album, personal archive, community forum, and more. Think, for a second, about deleting Facebook. What will happen to your photos? Where will you get your news? Will anyone remember your birthday?Â Like all social media companies, Facebook makes money from the basic labors of life: our need to maintain friendships and family ties, keep up with news, form and share beliefs about the world. \"What appears, at first glance, to be a free activity of communication,\" researchers at the University LÃ¼neburg and University of Essex wrote in a recent paper, \"is in fact a form of 'free labor.'\"Â It's valuable labor, too. The company earned nearly $16 billion in profit in 2017, according to its annual earnings report. Most of that was from ad revenue, which jumped nearly 50 percent.Â Free labor has always made the U.S. economy hum. Slavery got the country on its feet, and unpaid house work â cooking, cleaning and child care, still done mostly by women â has for over two centuries made it possible for people to wake up every morning and go to work. The effort we put into caring for others is labor, and women still do most of that, too. While employers mostly benefit from this unpaid work indirectly, social media companies go right to the source. They extract value directly from the work we do to stay connected to the world. This kind of extraction isn't unique to Facebook, or even to social media. The idea of a \"prosumer\" â a consumer who also produces â dates back to the 1980s. Sites like Yelp rely on users to generate reviews; Spotify asks listeners to fill in missing album data; Medium makes money from amateur writers looking to publish. Like Facebook, these sites often frame your work as an opportunity to \"connect\" or \"share.\" Not paying for this work is called \"crowdsourcing.\" Critics of this model say it's exploitation. Eric Posner, a legal theorist at the University of Chicago, has called Twitter users a \"slave labor force,\" and small-time YouTube celebrities have objected to the platform's efforts to make it harder for YouTubers to monetize videos.Â Whatever else it is, social media is work Whatever else it is, social media is work. People who create content for a living understand this better than most. If you're a photographer, you have to be on Instagram. And if you're a journalist, you have to be on Twitter. Itâs where you find breaking news, promote work, and get gigs â often on your own time. Ditching Twitter \"would be a disaster\" for writers and the companies they work for, Ethan Klapper, HuffPostâs global social media editor, told the New Republic in 2017.Â The nonstop churn of social media skews what kind of work has monetary value. Amateur reporters break news before professionals, so media companies expect writers to churn out reports off the clock. And when the internet is awash in content, no one wants to shell out for words and images they can get for free.Â Yes, a few social media users have figured out how to turn their work into cash. Modern celebrities like PewDiePie and the #vanlife couple have used social platforms to launch lucrative careers. It's easy to envy these people; after all, they rake in cash doing what everyone else does for free. But the fact that some people get paid is evidence of the value of every user's labor. Maybe we all deserve a little something. After all, we don't really use Facebook; we make it.Â Casey Williams is a writer based in Durham, North Carolina.

Cambridge Analytica was suspended from Facebook on Friday after they allegedly harvested private information from over 50 million Facebook users during the election. Not only did the firm use this data to launch a targeted, pro-Trump online campaign throughout 2016, but reports say their social media suspension is because they did not delete the data after promising to do so. New York Times obtained documents and interview transcripts showing that CAâs staff was in contact with business leaders from Lukoil in 2014 and 2015. These Russian oil giant executives held at least three meetings with the firm in London and Turkey, and they were particularly interested in learning how data is used to target Americans. Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and was involved in the Lukoil meetings, corroborated this by hinting that the executives wanted the use the company’s data gathering to send a message to voters. From the report. âI kept asking Alexander, âCan you explain to me what they want?ââ he said, referring to Mr. Nix. âI donât understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.â âWeâre sending them stuff about political targeting â they then come and ask more about political targeting,â Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil âjust didnât seem to be interestedâ in how the techniques could be used commercially. Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix denied that the firm ever worked with Russia when asked during a recent hearing before the British Parliament. âAs far as Iâm aware, weâve never worked for a Russian company,â Nix said. âWeâve never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country, and we donât have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.â Months ago, there was a great deal of intrigue regarding the news that Cambridge Analytica reached out to Julian Assange during the election. The firm was asking the Wikileaks founder for help in finding Hillary Clinton‘s missing emails."}
{"originalUrl":"https://www.wired.com/story/cambridge-analytica-50m-facebook-users-data/","title":"Trump Campaign Data Consultants Cambridge Analytica Took 50 Million Facebook Users' Data | WIRED","text":"Share Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm that worked on President Trump's 2016 campaign, and its related company, Strategic Communications Laboratories, pilfered data on 50 million Facebook users and secretly kept it, according to reports in The New York Times, alongside The Guardian and The Observer. The apparent misuse of Facebook dataâand the social media giant's failure to police itâleave both companies with plenty still to answer for. Facebook has suspended both Cambridge and SCL while it investigates whether both companies retained Facebook user data that had been provided by third-party researcher Aleksandr Kogan of the company Global Science Research, a violation of Facebook's terms. The suspensions were announced just hours before The New York Times and The Guardian published stories Saturday morning describing how Cambridge Analytica harvested data on 50 million US Facebook users, a number far larger than the 270,000 accounts Facebook initially cited. Facebook says it knew about the breach, but had received legally binding guarantees from the company that all of the data was deleted. \"We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made,\" Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and general counsel, wrote in a blog post Friday night. Facebook is also suspending Kogan, as well as Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, the whistleblower who led to stories in The Guardian and The New York Times. In a statement, a spokesperson for SCL denied the claims. \"Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data,\" the statement read. (Cambridge is an independent company in the United States that was spun out of SCL.) According to one source, a trove of Facebook users' personal data was visible on Cambridge's internal databases in 2017. And yet, following Facebook's announcement Friday night, sources close to Cambridge confirmed to WIRED that this data was still accessible as recently as last year. According to one source, a trove of Facebook users' personal data was visible on Cambridge's internal databases in 2017, despite SCL's current denial and past promises to both Cambridge employees and Facebook that it had all been deleted in 2015. The data included Facebook IDs, and responses to personality surveys that had been administered by Kogan in 2015. Another source close to the company recalled seeing a database called \"Kogan-import\" in Cambridge's system, which was only visible to a small number of staffers in data science, engineering, and IT. The source says the database was tightly controlled in terms of who could edit or delete it. Asked to confirm whether this database existed, an SCL spokesperson said, \"We did a system wide internal audit to verify that all GSR data had been removed before we signed an undertaking to Facebook.\" The data in question was gathered using an app called thisisyourdigitallife, created by Kogan, that offered Facebook users personality quizzes. Those who downloaded the app voluntarily turned over reams of personal data about what they like, where they live, and in some cases, depending on individual privacy settings, who their friends were. Though Facebook says just 270,000 people downloaded the app, a loophole at the time apparently allowed Kogan to collect vastly more information. Until 2014, apps could also collect information on every users' entire friend network. Facebook shut down that capability for app developers in mid-2014, but offered some apps that were already up and running a small grace period before cutting them off. That timing roughly lines up with Kogan's research. Of the 50 million accounts Kogan had data on, the New York Times and Guardian reports say, 30 million had complete enough profiles that Cambridge could create psychographic profiles of them. Different than demographic profiles, these describe people based on their personality types. Kogan passed the survey results on to SCL and Cambridge. Facebook learned about this violation in 2015, removed the app, and requested that Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information. In a statement, an SCL spokesperson said the company deleted the data as soon as they found out it violated Facebook's policies. Cambridge Analytica has spent years denying this exact sort of association with Kogan. In a 2016 WIRED interview, I asked Nix about a 2015 report in the Guardian, which described how Cambridge Analytica had amassed data from Kogan's app. Nix called the article \"unfounded,\" and said, \"We do not hold any data from third parties, whether itâs the person you mentioned or anybody else, and we certainly do not hold any data from third parties that hasnât been properly licensed or purchased through channels.\"1 That doesn't square with what SCL's own statement on Friday, which maintained that the company commissioned Kogan for a \"large scale research project in the US\" in 2014, and only deleted the data after it realized it had been obtained against Facebook's terms and conditions. Under this suspension, none of the involved companies will be permitted to buy ads or manage their clients' Facebook accounts. The Trump campaign hasn't worked with Cambridge since the 2016 election, according to a source close to the campaign. For Cambridge Analytica, this represents the nadir of what has been a steady downward spiral since election night 2016. Earlier Friday, David Carroll, a professor at the New School, filed a legal claim against SCL Group under British data protection law, seeking disclosures for how his data was used in the 2016 election and whether that US voter data was processed illegally overseas. The legal proceedings come in the midst of an ongoing investigation by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office into Cambridge Analytica's role in the Leave.EU campaign, which advocated for the United Kingdom to break with the European Union in the 2016 Brexit vote. Cambridge officials had spoken publicly about working for Leave.EU, but CEO Alexander Nix has since denied it in testimony before Parliament. On Saturday, the ICO issued a statement saying it continues to investigate how Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used. \"We are continuing to invoke all of our powers and are pursuing a number of live lines of inquiry. Any criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously,\" the statement said. 'Facebook never comes forward with information until their backs are against the wall.' Jonathan Albright, Columbia University Nix also became a key figure in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, after news broke that he had contacted representatives for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in the run-up to the election, seeking information about hacked emails Wikileaks had received. Nix has confirmed initiating this contact. This apparently prompted the Trump campaign to issue a statement seemingly designed to distance the campaign from Cambridge Analytica, a firm which had already amassed doubters and critics even before the 2016 election. Long before Cambridge even began working with the Trump campaign, Republican strategists accused the company of inflating its capabilities. Now, it appears even Cambridge is working to place rhetorical distance between Nix and the company's work in United States elections. In a statement provided to The New York Times, the company said Nix ânever had any strategic or operational roleâ in an American election. The chaos has led to a mass exodus from the company's nascent US political team. Nearly all of the staff that worked in the Trump campaign's San Antonio digital office are no longer at Cambridge, and sources say its political business within the United States has dwindled. Once feared by Republican digital firms as a threat to their business and by Democrats as a threat to democracy, Cambridge has steadily ceded influence since its 2016 highs. \"The defanging of Cambridge is about just colossal fuckups over and over,\" one source close to Cambridge said. Losing Facebook as an advertising platform, the source said, should further destabilize the already declining company. \"Thereâs no way this doesn't have a substantial impact on their business,\" another source familiar with Cambridge said. The weekend's revelations don't paint Facebook in a positive light, either. After two years in which Facebook has struggled to explain how Russian propaganda and fake news proliferated on the platform, it now must explain one of its fundamental flaws: Facebook offers unprecedented data to its paying clients, but has next to no controls in place to ensure that data will be handled properly. In a statement Saturday morning, Facebook's Grewal said, \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for allâand take action against all offending parties.â And yet, Facebook shares some of the blame. The company's executives have repeatedly been brought before Congress to testify about how the platform was used and abused during the 2016 election. The fact that the company discovered a major data breach by a vendor to the Trump campaign seems worthy of public disclosure well before three years have passed. \"Facebook never comes forward with information until their backs are against the wall,\" said Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism. \"This is a mess.\" Facebook can, of course, punish entities that violate its policies, as it is doing with Cambridge and SCL, and it may have grounds for legal action. But the damage has already been done."}

Because I know that they could have prevented it.â Photograph: Robert Gumpert Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower. Sandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach. Where's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds Read more âMy concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,â he said. Parakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that âpeople didnât read or understandâ and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused. Parakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings. âIt has been painful watching,â he said, âbecause I know that they could have prevented it.â Play Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer Asked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: âZero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.â Parakilas said he âalways assumed there was something of a black marketâ for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively âaudit developers directly and see whatâs going on with the dataâ he was discouraged from the approach. He said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: âDo you really want to see what youâll find?â Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that âFacebook was in a stronger legal position if it didnât know about the abuse that was happeningâ. He added: âThey felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.â Parakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had âsignificantly improvedâ over the last five years. âWhile itâs fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, itâs untrue to suggest we didnât or donât care about privacy,â that statement said. âThe facts tell a different story.â âA majority of Facebook usersâ Parakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebookâs previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends. That feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games â like the widely popular FarmVille â that were hosted on the platform. The apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the companyâs 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones. Facebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data. Parakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so. It has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it Parakilas estimates that âa majority of Facebook usersâ could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data. Parakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data. Legal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were âextremely rareâ, he said, adding: âIn the time I was there, I didnât see them conduct a single audit of a developerâs systems.â Facebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach. During the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and âone of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this dataâ. Shortly after arriving at the companyâs Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers. While the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook usersâ friendsâ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebookâs terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic. âIt was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,â he said. âFacebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didnât read or understand.â It was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users. The test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a âclose working relationshipâ with Facebook. While Koganâs app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users. âKoganâs app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,â Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users. If those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled âprivate and personally identifiableâ data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said. The ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added. Parakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data. He recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies. âThey were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,â he said. âThey were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.â âThey treated it like a PR exerciseâ Parakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for âa more rigorous approachâ to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 âthat included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebookâs platformâ. âI included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,â he said. âOn the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.â Frustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. âI didnât feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didnât speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.â That changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russiaâs attempt to sway the presidential election. âThey treated it like a PR exercise,â he said. âThey seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.â It was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself.

Facebook Still Has It. Thumbnails from videos a user never posted and believed she had deleted, but that Facebook saved anyway. Have you downloaded your Facebook data archive yet? Facebook makes it easy to obtain a ZIP file of all the data it has on you: your status updates, your friend list, your messages â¦ and, as I and several people I spoke with were surprised to discover, every video you ever filmed on the platform â including videos you never published. Cambridge Analyticaâs effect on the election is still disputed, but if thereâs one thing everyone can agree is true in the wake of the scandal over its data-harvesting, itâs that weâve paid far too little attention to the scale and scope of the data that Facebook has collected on us over our years of platform use. Itâs true that, in most cases, weâve âconsentedâ to this kind of data-gathering by clicking âokayâ on a dense terms-of-service contract, and neglecting to opt out. But given how often the details are ignored, itâs disconcerting to discover exactly what data has been gathered. Last week, Facebook users around the world discovered that Facebookâs Android app had, in some cases, Hoovered up extensive call data without their awareness. âWhen this feature is enabled, uploading your contacts also allows us to use information like when a call or text was made or received. This feature does not collect the content of your calls or text messages,â Facebook said, noting that users had to initially opt in to have their communication tracked. But it seems unlikely that many of the people who âopted inâ were aware that theyâd done so, or what exactly it meant. And call logs arenât the only data Facebookâs been holding to user surprise. Earlier this week, like many people around the world, my sister Bailey downloaded her Facebook data archives. Along with the contact lists and relationship statuses was something unexpected: several different videos of her attempting to play a scale on a wooden flute in her childhood bedroom. Each video, she discovered, was a different âtakeâ âÂ recorded on Facebook, but then, she assumed, discarded before she posted the final version to a friendâs wall. (In the archive, you can infer which video was posted on a wall versus the ones that werenât based on the comments. Videos that were never published are commentless.) In one of the clips, you can hear Kircher say, exasperatedly, that it is her 13th take. At the end of the clip, which isnât to her liking, she groans and reaches forward, apparently to delete the video and try again. Bailey Kircher never posted this video on Facebook, but still found a copy of it in her Facebook archive. How did this happen? In the preâFacebook Live era, leaving videos on your friendsâ walls was something of a crude FaceTime. Youâd post a video, theyâd respond with a video, and so forth. Importantly, Facebook had a feature that let users film videos via webcam on Facebook itself âÂ that is, without ever leaving the Facebook site to use a video recorder. Once you were done filming, Facebook would show you a preview of your clip. If you decided to do another take, you could click to discard that video and try it again. Except, the video wasnât actually deleted. Instead, Facebook apparently saved your unused clip. Another co-worker, Brittany Stephanis, found over 100 videos in her archive and says that she only ever publicly posted about a third of them. The earliest date back to Christmas Day in 2008 when Stephanis, then 13, started recording videos to wish her friends a happy holiday. Stephanis says that her archive contains videos she clearly never planned to shared with anyone. âThere are videos of me just checking my teeth,â she explained. My sister also had videos â rehearsing for school musicals and cheerleading â where she was using Facebookâs desktop camera to review herself and then erase, or so she thought, the video forever. I thought this was a funny quirk of my sisterâs. And then I looked at my own data archive. There, at the bottom of the list of videos Iâd put on the platform, I found clips that appear to have never been posted to Facebook but were saved anyway. From what I can tell, most people havenât noticed this yet. (Or, possibly, they have and are unperturbed.) One reason might be that the videos are saved in the FLV format, short for Flash Video. Most default video players canât read them, but you can watch them in VLC. You canât preview a .flv file in a file browser, which could make it a little trickier to figure out what videos Facebook has of yours. To find yours, download your data archive â instructions here â and open the file. Select the index, which will open your archive in your web browser. From there, click the video section to see whatâs what. (You might need to download the free app VLC player, which can play Flash videos.) Facebook saving data you didnât share isnât an entirely new concern. Back in 2013, thenâFacebook intern and Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon Sauvik Das and Adam Kramer, a Facebook data scientist, put together a study on what they deemed âself-censorshipâ on the platform. Self-censorship, according to their work, was anything a user typed in the status box but ultimately didnât post.Data that Facebook can track. Facebookâs current data policy says that the company can âcollect the content and other information you provide when you use our Services, including when you sign up for an account, create or share, and message or communicate with others.â âCreateâ is the operative word in there. By that logic, Facebook technically could save any video a user filmed but did not publish because you created it on the platform. Still, that requires the kind of close read of the fine print that most humans, at least not before Facebookâs ongoing Cambridge Analytica privacy fiasco, likely arenât taking the time to do. An industry expert recently told me about another âopen secretâ â that when Instagram first introduced video, the company would begin uploading a userâs video while they wrote a caption. That way, when the user pressed âpost,â the video would already be good to go, and the user wouldnât have to wait while the video uploaded in real time. Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger explained this in a presentation on the âSecrets to Lightning Fast Mobile Designâ in 2011. It doesnât seem unreasonable that a similar system might have been used at Facebook to create a faster, cleaner user experience. Except, unlike Instagram which says it threw out the data if a user cancelled the post, it appears Facebook was keeping the videos. I reached out to Facebook for comment today, and the company asked me to connect them with Kircher so she could consent to the company investigating why these outtakes were in her data archives. The representative told me the company thinks theyâve âgotten to the bottom of it,â but that Facebook was still figuring out what it could share. Later, a Facebook representative provided a statement saying that the company is still looking into the matter: âWeâve heard that when accessing their information from our Download Your Information tool, some people are seeing their old videos that do not appear on their profile or Activity Log. We are investigating.â The videos that Stephanis and Kircher found in their archives are pretty harmless, at least in terms of content. But itâs easy to imagine a user filming something that wasnât quite so juvenile and being horrified to discover that Facebook has a copy. Apropos of, well, everything, now seems like a good time to mention that Mark Zuckerberg keeps a piece of tape over his webcam. Seems like he might be onto something. Update, March 28, 6:16 p.m.: This piece has been edited to include a statement from Facebook. If youâve also found questionable things in your Facebook data archive, Iâd love to hear about it.

{"originalUrl":"https://wapo.st/2pAN3QX?tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.ee4273afafc6","title":"D.C. tech team with Facebook and Google DNA seeks to create data-driven deals company - The Washington Post","text":"E-commerce has not always been kind to the D.C. areaâs start-up community, especially since locally based daily-deals giant LivingSocial was sold to a competitor for zero dollars after collecting $900Â million from investors. But a three-year-old, 25-person start-up called GetUpside thinks its smartphone-based discount app can break the mold. Whereas âdaily dealsâ companies such as LivingSocial and Groupon would email customers electronic coupons that could pile up in their inboxes, GetUpside might be better-termed a âmobile dealsâ outfit. The company runs a smartphone app for Android and iOS that maps discounts on the basis of user location. Users can open the app and see cash-back deals displayed on a map, similar to the way Uber and Lyft show the locations of nearby drivers. Customers get cash back directly from GetUpside, which extracts a small fee from each deal it facilitates. An initial test-run that was limited to D.C.-area gas stations has worked well enough that the company recently expanded its app to include grocery stores and restaurants. âWeâre seeing early signs that this could work in a big way,â said GetUpside co-founder Wayne Lin. The brains behind GetUpside come from Google and Facebook. Lin and fellow founder Alex Kinnier are former Google employees who also worked at Opower, a local tech firm that was bought by Oracle for $532Â million. GetUpside got some of its first seed capital from FormationÂ 8, a technology investment fund founded by Gideon Yu, the former chief technology officer of Facebook. And Hal Varian, a widely published academic who is Googleâs chief economist, is an investor and close adviser. The discounts GetUpside offers can be pretty steep: up to 35Â percent off for some restaurants, up to 25Â cents cash back per gallon of gas for people using the app. Such large discounts are made possible by the way GetUpside plays retailers off each other. In its gasoline app, the firm offers its services to just one station within each competitive cluster (whichever signs up with GetUpside first), shutting out its street-corner competitors. Each consumer gets a different cash-back deal for a given location, making it impossible for that retailerâs competitors to find out the average price the retailer is getting through the app. Retailers can effectively lower their prices without their competitors finding out by exactly how much they are being undercut â effectively allowing the chosen gas stations to sidestep natural price competition, obscuring the âtrue priceâ of gas through the app. GetUpside is far from a household name, but there are initial signs that it is gaining market traction. In late 2016, for instance, the app had only 5,000 downloads. Deals were limited to a few hundred D.C.-area gas stations, and the firmâs user base was mainly Uber drivers. Now the app has 100,000 downloads and claims a total of 257,000 users in 10 cities. It employs about two dozen people, most of them working from home or from a WeWork co-working space in Chinatown. Lin says the business is growing quickly, although he declined to share revenue figures. GetUpside has also been courting a different sort of investor. It recently raised $11Â million from a group of investors that includes an oil company and a large financial-services firm, Lin says, declining to name them because of nondisclosure agreements. The undisclosed petroleum company gets âsome preference, but the preferences arenât very strongâ in terms of choosing which gas stations get to sign onto the app, Lin says. The gas company does not have access to GetUpsideâs trove of vendor and customer data, something that could be meant to allay competitorsâ concerns. âTheyâre seeing an opportunity for them where we can help their stations make money at a regional and local level,â Lin said. As the firm expands to grocery stores, it plans to apply that competitive dynamic, picking winners on individual blocks when stores compete for the same customers. So far, the firmâs foothold in the grocery market is small. Just 15 D.C.-area grocery stores, including Harris Teeter and Streets Market & Cafe, display on the app. GetUpsideâs founders say they want to differentiate themselves from the daily-deals business by sticking to products that people absolutely need, such as food and fuel. But the difference is really in the data, they say. Because discounts are processed by GetUpside and not the retailers, the company is able to show retailers exactly how much extra money they made through the partnership, managers say. âEvery customer gives incremental profit and we can prove that through the data that we use,â Lin said."}

Bezos takes a personal hit of more than $8.5 billion from the market dip for the e-commerce behemoth. The White House at an afternoon news conference said there's 'no specific policies or actions' that would apply to Amazon's business model that it's currently considering. But Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also noted that Trump is 'always looking to create a level playing field for all businesses' and his interest in pursuing an Internet sales tax 'is no different.'

Axios drove the market down earlier in the day with a report based on the word of five sources, including one who said that Trump was pondering ways to 'go after' Amazon.Â 'Heâs obsessed with Amazon,' a source said told the news website. 'Obsessed.' Trump's desire to further regulate Amazon has been inflamed by his wealthy friends' complaints that lax Internet commerce rules are killing their businesses, Axios reported. The president also believes that Amazon's thriving business model is hurting mom and pop stores that are owned by people who voted for him.Â A source told Axios that Trump has also blamed Amazon for losses suffered by the U.S. Post Office. 'The whole post office thing, that's very much a perception he has,' the source said. 'It's been explained to him in multiple meetings that his perception is inaccurate and that the post office actually makes a ton of money from Amazon.'Â RELATED ARTICLES Share this article Friendship didn't last:Â Trump shook hands with Jeff Bezos at the White House in June last year - but has become increasingly hostile to Amazon If you want a friend in Washington...: Bezos took a robotic dog for a walk around a secretive conference in California earlier this monthÂ Still, Trump is said to be actively seeking to come after Amazon using anti-trust or competition law, another source told Axios. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told the House of Representatives' tax-writing committee in February that the administration 'feels strongly' that Internet sales should be taxed. At a July appearance before the U.S. Senate where he was asked about the Internet sales tax, Mnuchin singled out Amazon. 'I am encouraged that Amazon is now charging tax, I believe, on their own sales but not the marketplace,' he said. 'I'm not sure I understand the consistency on that, but I respect the states' ability that there's an awful lot of money that's not being collected.' Amazon's stock share fell by as much as 7.4 percent on Wednesday, Reuters said, after the damaging Axios report ran. That's more than $53 billion in losses for the company in one day. Bezos is also the owner of The Washington Post, which Trump has labeled 'fake news' because of the stories it has done on him that he says are false representations.

{"originalUrl":"https://medium.com/@Platformula1/digital-skinner-box-marketing-196641c08678","title":"Digital Skinner Box Marketing â @Platformula1 â Medium","text":"Digital Skinner Box Marketing The new brand contagion Joseph Bentzel, Platformula Group Thatâs about the only humorous thing one can say about the not so funny revelations of a full spectrum âskinner box marketingâ experiment at Facebook. But no one should be surprised. Veteran VC Bill Davidow raised this issue more than a year ago using the lab rat metaphor. He used Google and others as examples. Hereâs what he said. âAnd the new Google Maps is just the start. Google, Facebook, Twitter, retailers, and thousands of application developers are now positioned to keep users engaged on Web sites and program behaviors. That is, to operant condition them.â Is this what âdigital marketingâ is becoming? Interactive operant conditioning designed to âprogram behaviorsââ¦ behavioral programming not just to sell you somethingâ¦but to keep you âhookedâ for the purpose of âlifetime customer valueâ monetization. Is digital skinner box marketing the latest incarnation of the 1-to-1 model being increasingly adopted by some in the new generation of digital marketers & growth hackersâââSome who apparently have little or no institutional memory of or appreciation for permissions-based marketing? Clearly thatâs a big part of it. But thereâs a lot more. The now shaky edifice of digital skinner box marketing, as currently practiced on a broad (I would say industry-wide) basis, is propped up by 3 primary pillars. They are: Pillar 1. Emotional manipulation as âstrategyâ. And the emotional manipulation is always and often rationalized under the flag of âserving the customerâ. Iâd argue that one can find better rationalizations at any well-attended meeting of Narcotics Anonymous or itâs TV proxy. âI sold meth because I had to pay my medical bills.â Got it Walter White. But hereâs the thing. âemotional manipulation as strategyâ is not confined to Facebook. Itâs now a widespread phenomenon practiced by CMOs and brand marketers around the world. See the Brandworks University ad below as an example of how this strategy is pitched to CMOs. Pillar 2. The new âchief marketing technologistâ as that âman behind the strategy curtainâ. Bill Davidow really only scratched the surface in his largely ignored warnings from June 2013. The âchief marketing technologistâ trend is a case in point. Todayâs chief marketing technologist trend is all about the new crop of digital marketing ops platforms used to continuously âengageâ users of apps and web services and systematically move them through âthe funnelâ while of course âreducing churnâ. The chief marketing technologist wave even made it into the Harvard Business Review. On the surface the âchief marketing technologistâ looks like strategic marketing progress in the digital age. But when you combine these powerful technologies with emotional manipulation as strategyâ-youâre getting pretty close to something more than a few folks see as unethical. And thatâs not just me saying that. Itâs that rash of headlines in the past 24 hours reacting to the Facebook A/B testing experiment. Headlines I would characterize more as âbrand contagionâ for Facebook than brand building. Facebook should have seen this reaction coming. The intelligence community has a word for this. They call it âblowbackâ. An unintended consequence that happens when an operation in the field goes sideways. Hereâs the upside. Itâs an opportunity window for Facebook competitors to reposition themselves as âethical online brandsâ by publicly repudiating emotional manipulation as strategyâ-especially when tightly coupled with âmarketing technologyâ. Are you listening Marissa Mayer? Are you listening Satya Nadella? Are you listening branding and digital marketing agencies of record around the world? Are you ready to de-scroogle-ize your marketing strategy and capitalize on the skinner box marketing blowback that is coming to a brand near you? If you do, I think youâll be pleasantly surprised at the stampede of support and customer adoption. Emotional manipulation as strategy and the chief marketing technologist toolset need fuel to power their behavioral marketing drone. That fuel is âbig dataâ. And not just any big data but the kind of big data that provides a 360 degree surround-sound view of the specimen in the digital skinner box, aka the consumer. The big data component of the skinner box data management model is now on the agenda at the big analyst firms. They call it âcustomer contextâ. I suspect that what we might see soon is a new kind of subscription SaaS âcustomer contextâ application along the lines of LifeLock in identity theft protection. Letâs call it BigDataBlowBack. It may already exist as a âprofile protectionâ as a service platform in some ethical developerâs roadmap. With BigDataBlowback all interaction between me and the new world order of digital marketing skinner boxes (aka apps) proceeds through BigDataBlowback. Itâs my new single-sign-on (SSO) provider, my new virtual IP address & location scrambler, and my new repository of frequent user âengagementâ points I get paid to let you target, re-target and monetize me as a carbon life form unit with âlifetime customer valueâ. Itâs big data strategy applied by consumers for consumers, not big data applied by brands for brands. Itâs the actual manifestation of what the skinner box marketers pay lip service toâ-customer power. Iâm not holding my breath to see BigDataBlowback on the market anytime soon. With M&A valuations the way theyâve been going, it would probably get bought just to get shelved. They donât call it shelving. They call it an âaqui-hireâ. But if youâre out there working on it let me know. Iâll help you write the product requirements doc, tell your story, and line up a few ethical upstream partners to make it a reality. Final Thoughts As Iâve written before, the consumerization of IT does not and should not equal the consumerization of IT marketing. The anti-Facebook headlines should convince you of that. So hereâs the obligatory takeaways that one needs in a 21st century blog post. Takeaway 1: For B2B/B2DÂ Players: If your company is a B2B or B2D technology provider in the XaaS (anything as a service) world, you should run from digital skinner box marketing as fast as you can. And if youâre a marketing technology platform company with any brand association to skinner box marketing methodologyâ-youâre going to need a brand makeover sooner rather than later. The blowback is only going to grow, not subside. Get out in front of it. Takeaway 2: For B2C Players & BrandÂ Agencies When everybody else zigs, you zag. If youâre a B2C company or agency serving a B2C companyâtry something new and potentially âdisruptiveâ. Try crafting a rational, fact-based value proposition and brand messaging platform enabled by what Sun Tzu (and maybe even the new improved and recently sober Don Draper) would call a âmoral compassâ."}

The system, which will be introduced to Facebook users globally over the coming weeks, will allow people to change their privacy and security settings from one place rather than having to go to roughly 20 separate sections across the social media platform. From Facebookâs new privacy settings page, users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them. Â Â ( Facebook / via The Associated Press ) From the new page, users can control the personal information the social network keeps on them, such as their political preferences or interests, and download and review a file of data Facebook has collected about them. Facebook also will clarify what types of apps people are currently using and what permissions those apps have to gather their information. Facebook began developing the centralized system last year but sped it up after revelations that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million users of the social network. The amount of data Cambridge Analytica obtained about Facebook users reawakened fears over how much information the social network has gathered about people, leading to a #DeleteFacebook movement and other criticism. “The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” Erin Egan, Facebook’s chief privacy officer, and Ashlie Beringer, a Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement announcing the new system. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed.” The Cambridge Analytica scandal has plunged Facebook into its worst crisis in years, with regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Britain demanding answers about how the social network deals with data privacy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has agreed to appear in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill next month, people familiar with the decision have said. Last week, Zuckerberg said in a statement that Facebook had to do better with user data and promised to roll out products that give users more control over their information and privacy settings. Opinion: The issue wasnât whether youâd done something evil or just embarrassing. It was that your legitimate data could be used to manipulate you and others to benefit forces that were greedy or dangerous. “One of our biggest responsibilities is to protect data,” he told The New York Times last week. “Whenever there’s an issue where someone’s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn’t have allowed it to, that’s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar.” Article Continued Below From the new centralized page, people will be able to opt out of sharing certain traits — for example, they can indicate that they no longer want to be identified as someone who loves cats. That information, by extension, will no longer be sent to advertisers. Facebook also plans to clarify the information being gathered by apps that hook into Facebook. Several seemingly innocent apps that allow users to play games with their friends or share photos could also be quietly monitoring their posts, interactions with friends, and contacts. In the new centralized page, people will be given a streamlined list of what each app is collecting on them, as well as the ability to delete the apps. Some privacy advocates wondered whether the new system would make a difference. “The platform made similar promises many times before,” said Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina who studies how technology affects society. She pointed out that in 2010, Zuckerberg said in the Washington Post that Facebook users needed simpler controls over their privacy and had promised then that Facebook would “add privacy controls that are much simpler to use.” Yet eight years later, the same concerns have resurfaced, Tufekci said. “The past decade shows that user concerns over privacy appear to have little teeth on changing how the platform behaves, aside from a recycling of contrite statements and promises to do better from its CEO,” she said.

In April 2016, Mark Zuckerberg delivered the keynote address at Facebookâs annual F8 Developer Conference, in which he shared the companyâs aspiration to âgive everyone the power to share anything with anyone.â In the wake of last weekâs revelations on unauthorized use of the companyâs massive user database, with possibly catastrophic influence on the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, itâs fair to presume that Facebookâs CEO now wishes some folks didnât take his comments so literally. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Itâs been hard to fathom how a company reputed to be run by one of the worldâs most brilliant digirati, could have been so naÃ¯ve in not recognizing the risks in giving outside developers broad access to Facebookâs user data, so lax in failing to ensure that rogue data in malevolent hands was destroyed before it could be weaponized, and so reluctant to advise users that their personal information was (and still is) floating around cyberspace. In short, what was Mark Zuckerberg thinking? During the protracted silence from Facebookâs CEO and COO, other senior company executives took to Twitter and Facebook to deny corporate culpability. One post vigorously disputed that Facebookâs systems had been breached, insisting on a technically correct, but blame-shifting explanation: âThis was unequivocally not a data breach. People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. No systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen or hacked.â This semantics lesson on the meaning of âbreachâ provided little comfort to users, who rarely parse the fine print in Facebookâs terms of service, and in any event expect Facebook to protect their private data from harmful and unauthorized use. As Mark Zuckerberg finally acknowledged in his long-awaited response (on Facebook of course), âWe have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. â In another instance of Facebookâs inadequate initial response, a Facebook spokesperson told The Daily Beast, âThe entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.â But Facebookâs outrage was too little, too late, as the cause of the companyâs breach of trust should have been recognized and forcefully addressed over three years earlier. In 2014, a Cambridge University academic, Aleksandr Kogan gave a publicized speech in Singapore, describing how he was able to analyze a sample of over 50 million Facebook users for whom he developed âthe ability to predict virtually any trait.â Kogan also boasted of having built a database of every friendship made in the world on Facebook from 2006-2012. One year later, The Guardian published a detailed account of how campaign consultancy Cambridge Analytica â who had paid to gain access to Koganâs massive database on unwitting US Facebook users â was using detailed psychological profiles on the US electorate for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. In response, Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to certify (as in âcheck the box on this formâ) that they had destroyed the ill-gotten user data. But Facebook failed to pursue any forensic follow up to ensure that this dangerously potent asset had in fact been wiped clean. In early 2016, the Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, and paid the firm over $6 million with the remit to provide a wide range of services including data analytics, voter profiling, micro-targeting, social media message development, digital marketing and campaign planning. Did Cambridge Analytica continue to use its ill-gotten massive Facebook database on behalf of the Trump campaign? Circumstantial evidence certainly points in that direction. Whistleblower Chris Wylie has recounted that Cambridge Analytica board member Steve Bannon had exhorted employees to weaponize psychological profiling in a self-proclaimed âwin-at-any-costâ culture war being fought on the 2016 election battlefield. The Financial Times reported that Cambridge Analyticaâs CEO, Alexander Nix, boasted of using âa massive database of [nearly] 5,000 data points on every adult in Americaâ to support the successful Trump campaign. And immediately after the election, Cambridge Analytica took credit for the win, claiming that its data helped to place targeted online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times. In his belated mea culpa, Zuckerberg admitted that Facebook âmade mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.â But the companyâs track record of systemic failures to protect user privacy or to prevent malevolent uses of its proprietary database suggests that were it not for investigative reporting by the New York Times, Observer and undercover reporting by Channel 4 News in London, we probably would not be having an urgent public discourse on Facebookâs management shortcomings today. Why has Facebook consistently struggled to protect its usersâ personal information and to prevent malicious exploitation of its platform? Going forward, can we trust Facebook to âtake whatever steps are requiredâ to address serious concerns with their business practices? The most common answer to the first question is that Facebookâs business model inexorably drives their observed behavior. After all, Facebookâs success is built on amassing (or less charitably, surveilling) information on consumer behavior, enabling it to sell targeted advertising that delivers superior marketing ROI. This devilishly effective business model has enabled Facebook to create an extraordinarily profitable enterprise â in round numbers, a $50 billion revenue run rate, growing at 50% per year with 50% operating margins. It is thus not surprising that the company would be reluctant to tinker with such successful business practices. The Perfect Storm Behind Mark Zuckerbergâs Corporate Myopia But there is deeper dynamic at play that explains Facebookâs chronic inability to recognize the potential societal harm and reputational risk that its platform can and has engendered. Mark Zuckerbergâs corporate myopia results from the perfect storm of three leadership mindsets. Hubristic vision and soaring ambition to change the world for the better Overconfidence in the power of technology to solve virtually any problem A tendency to underestimate âblack swanâ risks While these management mindsets are not uncommon in Silicon Valley, when applied in a company of Facebookâs scale, the consequences can be catastrophic. Mark Zuckerberg passionately believes that the company he founded nearly fifteen years ago has emerged as a uniquely powerful global force for good. He has often proclaimed that the Internet should be considered, like health care and clean water, a basic human right. And within that realm, Zuckerberg regards peer-to-peer communications as a powerful enabler of the companyâs mission to âgive people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.â Guided by such an altruistic vision, Zuckerberg propelled Facebookâs rapid growth by aggressively pursuing more data, more media, more interactions inside and beyond the platform, more functionality, more user engagement and more global scale and reach. But in retrospect, the companyâs fateful error was Zuckerbergâs decision to share user data with outside app developers starting in 2008 (expanded further between 2011 and 2014) in exchange for enhancing Facebookâs functionality and the ability to track its users beyond its platform. By extending Facebookâs surveillance beyond the walled garden of internally generated user data, the company signaled its preference for more data acquisition and portability over safeguarding user privacy. MAU growthAuthor analysis from company data Along the way, Facebook certainly was aware of âbad actorsâ on its platform â the ones that bully users, plant fake news for profit, mindless fun or influence, or who promote fraudulent commerce. But Zuckerberg has consistently exuded confidence that his companyâs sophisticated software could detect and prevent malevolent abuses on his platform, despite alarming evidence that Facebookâs bad actor problem has been worsening for years. There were plenty of reasons for Zuckerberg to overlook danger signs bubbling below the surface of Facebookâs business. By any measure, Facebook had been spectacularly successful in creating a global juggernaut. By the end of 2017, Facebook was serving over 2 billion users and more than 5 million advertisers, rewarding shareholders (including its largest stakeholder, Mark Zuckerberg) with a company valued in excess of one-half trillion dollars. Such outsized success undoubtedly contributed to Zuckerbergâs corporate myopia in failing to recognize and mitigate the risks of rare, but potentially catastrophic abuses on his platform. Best-selling author and scholar Nassim Taleb has written extensively on the common human tendency to underestimate the likelihood of âblack swanâ events â defined as situations with low probability but extremely high downside risk. For example, black swan myopia arguably contributed to the lax risk management that led to a number of preventable disasters, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the financial services meltdown of 2008. In Facebookâs case, black swan myopia led Mark Zuckerberg to largely ignore the reputational risk posed by the malevolent use of Facebook user data before, during and after the 2016 presidential election. Before Cambridge Analytica even began working for the Trump campaign, Facebook failed to verify that the consultancy had actually destroyed its large illicit cache of Facebook user data. During the campaign, Facebook continued to ignore growing reports that the Trump campaign was effectively deploying psychological profiling and micro-targeting techniques, rife with fake news and targeted imagery in pivotal swing states. And even after President Trumpâs gobsmacking victory, Zuckerberg continued to proclaim that the notion that fake news could have influenced the U.S. presidential election was a \"pretty crazy idea,\" going on to dismiss the importance of filter bubbles and claiming that fake news represents a \"very small volume\" of the total content on Facebookâs platform. Zuckerbergâs stubborn denial of the ability of Cambridge Analytica and other foreign political operatives to exploit Facebookâs data and platform to influence voter behavior is bizarrely hypocritical, since the secret sauce that has always driven Facebookâs profitability is its proven ability to enable advertisers to precisely tailor product messaging to targeted prospective customers. According to whistleblower Chris Wylie, Steve Bannon helped launch Cambridge Analytica with the stated objective of using psychological profiling tools to change votersâ cultural attitudes. In fighting a self-proclaimed culture war, Bannon understood that micro-targeting â akin to smart bombs â could be far more cost effective than carpet bombing political ads on mass media. Cambridge Analytica arguably was in a position to be particularly effective in this regard because they illicitly gained the access to Facebookâs vast user database to build detailed psychological profiling models. Mark Zuckerberg is not alone in falling prey to the perfect storm of corporate myopia. One could argue that Travis Kalanick at Uber and Elizabeth Holmes at Theranos also had hubristic visions to change the world for the better, coupled with overconfidence in the infallibility of their technology and an inability to recognize black swan risks threatening to damage their company and the world at large. Kalanick was ultimately forced to resign from Uber by his board, and Holmes recently settled a lawsuit with the SEC that forced her to forfeit control of Theranos, now in tatters. There are of course key differences in Zuckerbergâs case. Unlike the other two executives, Facebook has been spectacularly profitable, and Zuckerberg enjoys bulletproof shareholder control of his company. Under these circumstances, the question is, how will Mark Zuckerberg address the growing challenges threatening Facebookâs future? Can Zuckerberg Clean Up Facebookâs Mess? The key to answering this question lies in understanding what problem Mark Zuckerberg will choose to address: quelling the current uproar over the Cambridge Analytica debacle, or addressing broader, longstanding concerns with Facebookâs unprecedented global power to control access to information hiding behind its opaque business practices. Zuckerbergâs mea culpa media tour starting March 21st clearly signaled his primary interest on the first problem. In his interview with Recodeâs Kara Swisher, Zuckerberg opined âthe good news is that as of three or four years ago, new apps werenât able to do what happened here. So this is largely ... this issue is resolved going forward for a while.â As Swisher rightfully observed, Zuckerbergâs comments were predominantly backward-looking, and inadequately recognized the broader challenges that lie ahead. By focusing Facebookâs attention on tracking down possible terms of service violations by thousands of third party developers many years ago, and promising new controls on developer platform access, Zuckerberg framed Facebookâs problem entirely in terms of external data portability, ignoring the fact that through these interactions, Facebook also amassed and retains extensive data on user behavior for its own commercial purposes. Worries over just how much user data Facebook routinely collects and how that information is used erupted again this week when press accounts revealed that Facebook has been logging Android usersâ telephone calls and SMS messages for years. As with prior concerns expressed over the companyâs expansive data capture, Facebook reprised its typical response: âwe never sell your data and trust us, having all this information helps us provide a better user experience on our platform.â But a growing chorus of political leaders no longer trusts Facebookâs blame-shifting apologies and repeated assurances of altruistic intent, and are now calling for the companyâs CEO to testify before Congress on a broad range of data privacy concerns. The FTC has also weighed in, opening an investigation to determine whether Facebookâs business practices have been violating a 2011 agreement settling charges over the companyâs user privacy policies. So how can we expect Facebook to respond? Given Mark Zuckerbergâs management mindset, and the companyâs track record in dealing with past crises, it would take overwhelming pressure from the government or other key stakeholders for Facebook to move beyond reactive tweaks to its business practices. The harsh reality is, Facebookâs stakeholders are unlikely to mount a serious and sustained challenge to the companyâs status quo. Users The potential for a user revolt clearly poses the gravest threat to Facebookâs market dominance, which explains why Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg have devoted so much of their apology tour last week seeking to restore user trust. Facebook executives are well aware that Uber reportedly lost as much as 15 percentage points of market share in major US metro markets last year after a #deleteuber campaign erupted over the companyâs alleged mishandling of its response to protests over President Trumpâs Muslim country travel ban. In Uberâs case, consumers had a readily available choice to switch to a competitor (Lyft) offering an essentially comparable service. Facebookâs situation is considerably different. Despite the genuine outrage expressed over recent damaging revelations, isolated calls to #deletefacebook have failed to gain much traction simply because Facebook is too deeply embedded in the lives of its 2 billion users. Consciously or unwittingly, the vast majority of Facebook users appear to have accepted the Faustian bargain of trading their personal data for free access to Facebookâs valued services. Donât expect many Facebook or Instagram users to switch to Snapchat any time soon. Advertisers As long as users remain engaged on the platform, advertisers will be understandably reluctant to exclude Facebook from their advertising mix. No platform provides nearly as much market reach, targeting effectiveness or useful ROI tracking tools as Facebook. Consequently, why would Facebookâs 5 million advertisers be willing to cede such advantages to competitors? While a few companies have in fact announced a temporary suspension of Facebook advertising (e.g., Pep Boys, Sonos, Commerzbank), Facebook is likely to remain a dominant a channel for most advertisers in the months ahead. Investors/Government As long as users and advertisers stay on board, many investors are likely to follow suit. Facebookâs recent loss of market value largely reflects current investor nervousness over the prospect for restrictive government regulation. Mark Zuckerberg surprisingly fanned the flames of investor concern by signaling his support for appropriate regulatory controls. But there are reasons to doubt that government action will be swift, comprehensive or overly damaging to Facebookâs business model. For starters, President Trump will obviously seek to discourage debate on an issue that relitigates the legitimacy of his 2016 election. On Capitol Hill, Congress already has a full agenda of more pressing political issues to deal with, going into the 2018 midterm elections. As such, todayâs announcement that the FTC is launching an investigation of Facebook may give Congress cover to pass the baton in dealing with this gnarly issue. It would not be surprising to see Facebook voluntarily announcing a few enhancements to its data privacy policies in the coming months to diminish the perceived urgency for comprehensive government regulation. These dynamics suggest that government action is likely to be slow and measured at best, giving investors time to monitor and react to Facebookâs actual financial performance in the months ahead, which promises to remain strong. Board of directors Facebook has a distinguished board that in normal circumstances could be counted on to exert strong oversight over the company's operational and reputational risk management. But a board can go only so far in reining in a CEO who controls 60% of the voting shares of the fifth largest publicly traded company in the world. Mark Zuckerberg will continue to be the loudest voice in the room in guiding Facebookâs strategic direction. Competitors What competitors? Facebook has exploited strong network economies of scale and a relentless appetite to acquire or replicate the services of upstart competitors. While it is true that Facebook will likely be barred from additional major acquisitions, the company has already built a seemingly unassailable lead over competitors in the advertising-supported social media space. Even if Congress does act to impose limits on future user data sourcing and portability, it may actually strengthen Facebookâs current competitive advantage given that it already has by far the biggest user database in the industry. So where does that leave us? In the months ahead, weâre likely to see a number of incremental improvements in Facebookâs business practices through a combination of voluntary company policy changes and possible regulatory reforms governing the allowable sourcing and use of personal data. Greater transparency in identifying the sponsors and content of targeted ads on Facebookâs platform (particularly those involving political content) Tighter controls over user data portability across the Internet More stringent requirements for users to be asked for opt-in permission (in clear language) before Facebook can collect and store user data. These welcome changes will not unduly crimp Facebookâs extraordinarily successful business model, and may even help Mark Zuckerberg overcome his corporate myopia that has exposed the company to preventable reputational risk in the past. Whether we âLikeâ it or not, weâre destined to live in the social media world we collectively helped Facebook build for many more years to come.

Several executives took to Twitter to insist that the data leak was not technically a \"breach.\" But critics were outraged by the response and accused the company of playing semantics and missing the point. Facebook and its executives faced a torrent of backlash on Saturday following news reports that the data firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on the Trump campaign in 2016, improperly harvested private information from 50 million Facebook users. The company quickly faced calls for increased regulation and oversight, and Massachusetts' Attorney General, Maura Healey, even announced an investigation. \"This is a major breach that must be investigated. It's clear these platforms can't police themselves,\" she said on Twitter. \"I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say 'trust us.' Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.\" But much of the online outrage came after multiple Facebook executives took to Twitter to respond to the news reports, insisting the incident was not a \"data breach.\" \"This was unequivocally not a date breach,\" longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth tweeted. \"People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen and hacked.\" In a series of tweets that have since been deleted, Facebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, insisted that although user's personal information may have been misused, it wasn't retroactively a \"breach.\" \"The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a \"breach\" under any reasonable definition of the term,\" Stamos tweeted. \"We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it.\" Twitter users were not satisfied with that response â many accused the executives of deliberately missing the point by focusing on semantics. us (dumb, bad): facebook data breachfacebook (smug): it canât be a breach when its working exactly like itâs supposed to. wait donât write that dow â Casey Johnston (@caseyjohnston) March 17, 2018 Facebook's defense that Cambridge Analytica harvesting of FB user data from millions is not technically a \"breach\" is a more profound & damning statement of what's wrong with Facebook's business model than a \"breach\". â zeynep tufekci (@zeynep) March 17, 2018 (b) the distinction youâre drawing between this infraction and a data breach is meaningful from your perspective, but not from ours.

Brightline Trains plans to take up the XpressWest project in hopes of bringing an electric-powered train to the West Coast. The company currently operates high-speed trains in Florida, connecting Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. A private, Florida-based transportation company said it plans to acquire a long-dormant high-speed rail project designed to connect Las Vegas to Southern California. Brightline Trains plans to take up the XpressWest project, in hopes of developing an electric-powered train service for the West Coast, The Wall Street Journal reported. Brightline already operates high-speed trains in Florida, connecting Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. It was not immediately clear how much Brightline paid for the rights to the XpressWest project. It had already received many of the state and federal approvals it needed to get underway. The project is expected to run 185 miles along Interstate 15, the main artery between Southern California and Las Vegas. Initially, the train will run from the Las Vegas Strip to the California desert city of Victorville, which sits about 85 miles northeast of Los Angeles. XpressWest, which was originally conceived in 2005 by famed Las Vegas Strip contractor Tony Marnell, stalled due to a lack of funding. Brightline officials addressed that in a press release on Tuesday: âEstimates have shown the XpressWest project to cost $7 billion, but Brightline officials believe they can cut that in half.â Ben Porritt, a company spokesperson, told Business Insider on Tuesday. Experts have expressed doubt about whether the high-speed train project is financially viable. Some pointed to a bullet train project meant to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco â the costs of which have ballooned to $60 billion, according to the latest estimates. But Brightline officials highlighted a study conducted by the High Desert Corridor Joint Powers Authority, an agency that supports the project. Its study claims as high-speed train could generate about $1 billion in annual revenue by 2035. Brightline is expected to start building the rail line in 2019, and power it up by 2022. Top 11 waiver-wire pickups for Week 3 in your fantasy football league Two weeks of football are now in the books, and for fantasy football players, that means the season is starting to take shape. You begin to get a sense of where your team might need to improve, which of your sleepers might not pan out, and what your weak spots will be once bye weeks begin. Thankfully, there's still plenty of talent to be found on the waiver wire in Week 2 â it's early enough in the season that jobs and depth charts are still changing, meaning there's still plenty of plays to be made, even if your team is off to a rough start. Below we've collected 11 potential waiver-wire targets for fantasy players looking to bolster their rosters. Whether your team is in need of a backup quarterback, a bye-week fill in for later in the year, or a potential breakout player after a less than stellar draft, there are options at every position to help you put yourself in position to win your league. All ownership percentages come from ESPN, and scoring is based on a standard ESPN points per reception format. Ryan Fitzpatrick, QB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers One thing to know: Ryan Fitzpatrick was the first player mentioned in our Week 1 waiver wire pickups, but after another impressive performance against an Eagles defense expected to be one of the best in the league, he's worth another mention as he's owned in just 30.9% of leagues. He'll at least be starting for the Buccaneers through Week 4, and if he keeps playing at anything similar to this pace, he might hold on to the job even after Jameis Winston is ready to rejoin the team. Matt Breida, RB, San Francisco 49ers One thing to know: Matt Breida was thrust into the starting job in San Francisco after Jerick McKinnon tore his ACL just days before the start of the season. While his Week 1 performance was underwhelming, he broke out in Week 2. He's already owned in a majority of leagues, but it's worth checking to see if he's available when putting together your waiver claims. Austin Ekeler, RB, Los Angeles Chargers One thing to know: Austin Ekeler was also one of our Week 1 pickups, and after another double-digit fantasy performance, it's a bit easier to believe he'll continue to have value in the No. 2 role behind Melvin Gordon. Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser wants the FBI to investigate her claims before she testifies to Senate committee, and it could delay his Supreme Court confirmation indefinitely Attorneys for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her during their high school years in the 1980s, wants \"a full investigation by law enforcement officials\" of the alleged incident. Ford's attorneys said in a letter that a federal investigation must be conducted, prior to any hearings, in order \"ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed.\" Prior to the letter, lawmakers were awaiting Ford's response to their request for a public hearing set for Monday. The letter also confirmed earlier reports that Ford, a mother of two teenagers, was targeted with death threats after she came forward with her allegations against Kavanaugh. The Justice Department previously said that the allegation \"does not involve any potential federal crime\" to warrant an FBI investigation. Attorneys for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her during their high school years in the 1980s, said she wants \"a full investigation by law enforcement officials\" for the alleged incident prior to her making an appearance in a public hearing, according to a CNN report published Tuesday. Ford's attorney's wrote in a letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, saying that an FBI investigation would \"ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner,\" and would be critical \"before conducting any hearing or making any decisions.\" \"We would welcome the to opportunity to talk with you and Ranking Member [Dianne] Feinstein to discuss reasonable steps as to how Dr. Ford can cooperate while also taking care of her own health and security,\" the letter reportedly said. \"What we're saying is there should be an investigation because that's the right thing to do,\" Lisa Banks, Ford's attorney, said to CNN host Anderson Cooper. \"She is prepared to cooperate with the committee and with any law enforcement investigation.\" Sen. Diane Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, cosigned Ford's request for an investigation. \"We should honor Dr. Blasey Fordâs wishes and delay this hearing,\" Feinstein said in a statement on Tuesday. \"A proper investigation must be completed, witnesses interviewed, evidence reviewed and all sides spoken to. Only then should the chairman set a hearing date.\" Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who chairs the finance committee, pushed back on Ford's request for an FBI investigation: \"The FBI does not do investigations like this. The responsibility falls to us,\" Hatch wrote, reiterating Grassley's offer to let Ford testify before the Judiciary Committee. \"We should proceed as planned,\" he said. The Justice Department said in a statement on Monday that the sexual assault allegation \"does not involve any potential federal crime\" to warrant an FBI investigation, according to The Associated Press. The letter also confirmed earlier reports that Ford, a mother of two teenagers, was targeted with death threats. Earlier on Tuesday, the New York Times reported that after Ford went public with her allegation, she moved out of her house and arranged for a private security detail after she received vulgar emails and messages on social media. Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, was said to be \"stumbling drunk\" when he allegedly sexually assaulted Ford during a party in high school. She claimed Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed, groped her over her clothes, and covered her mouth with his hand when she started to scream. Prior to the letter from Ford's attorneys, lawmakers were left in limbo after multiple messages for Ford to appear in a public hearing went unanswered. After the Senate Judiciary Committee's planned vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation on Thursday was delayed, the committee announced on Monday it would hold a public hearing next week for Kavanaugh and Ford. Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegation and said he would testify to \"refute this false allegation.\" It is unclear if a full investigation would be concluded before the planned public hearing on Monday. Key witnesses appeared reluctant to discuss the alleged incident or have no memory of it. Mark Judge, Kavanaugh's former classmate who became implicated in the allegation, already signaled that he was unwilling to appear before the Judiciary Committee. \"I have no more information to offer the Committee and I do not wish to speak publicly regarding the incidents described in Dr. Ford's letter,\" Judge said in a statement.

Ford, a mother of two teenagers, has received vulgar emails and messages on social media, a New York Times report said. \"From what I've heard you have 6 months to live, you disgusting slime,\" one of the messages reportedly read. Ford and her attorney have yet to respond to invitations to testify at a public hearing about her allegations against Kavanaugh. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her during their high school years in the 1980s, has moved out of her house and hired private security detail because of death threats she has received since coming forward. A person familiar with the matter told The New York Times that Ford, a mother of two teenagers, began receiving vulgar emails and messages on social media. \"From what I've heard you have 6 months to live, you disgusting slime,\" one of the messages allegedly read. The Times' source added that Ford has also received supportive messages after giving her account of the alleged incident: \"Ninety percent of people think she's a hero and are extremely supportive of her, and 10 percent want her to die immediately,\" the person told the newspaper. In July, Ford initially wrote about her allegation in a letter that was eventually sent to Sen. Diane Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the time, Ford reportedly expected her story to remain confidential and her identity anonymous. Ford decided to go public with her account after it was leaked and inaccurate reports emerged. \"These are all the ills that I was trying to avoid,\" Ford said to The Washington Post. \"Now I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation.\" The committee's planned vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation on Thursday was delayed after Democrats and a few key Republican lawmakers expressed hesitation about moving forward. The committee announced on Monday it would hold a public hearing next week for Kavanaugh and Ford. Kavanaugh has denied the allegation and said he would testify to \"refute this false allegation\" and \"defend my integrity.\" Until late Tuesday, Ford and her attorney had not yet responded to the committee's hearing request. It soon emerged that the attorney sent a letter to the Republican Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley, asking that the FBI investigate Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh to \"ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner.\" The letter revealed Tuesday evening confirmed The New York Times' earlier reporting about threats Ford has received, saying Ford has \"been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats.\" Ford's attorney continued, according to CNN: \"We would welcome the opportunity to talk with you and Ranking Member Feinstein to discuss reasonable steps as to how Dr. Ford can cooperate while also taking care of her own health and security.\" SEE ALSO: Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation chances are starting to unravel 13 rules to help your business survive a game-changing tech threat, by an exec who went through it firsthand To hear the experts tell it, if your business is connected to healthcare, energy, financial services manufacturing or call centers, then there's a chance you'll soon be toast. A group of companies, including Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and Intel are investing big money to develop artificial intelligence and other game-changing technology. These new AI superpowers are expected to pay your industry a visit in the not-so-distant future, leaving key parts of your product obsolete and the economics of your business in tatters. The good news is that some people have faced the dramatic changes brought on by a technological tsunami and seen their sectors not only survive, but eventually flourish again. Cary Sherman, CEO and Chairman of the Recording Industry Association of America, the lobbying group for the three top music labels, is one of those survivors. The advent of digital music files and online sharing that started in the late 1990s plunged the music industry into its darkest period â in 2009, at the low point, US annual music sales fell to $6.3 billion, less than half of the $14.6 billion posted for 1999. Now, nearly a decade later, annual music sales are growing again and consumers are paying for streaming services that provide access to an unprecedented trove of music. It wasn't easy. Sherman and the record labels endured numerous false starts, surprises and setbacks. They erred. The number of labels fell from five to three. They laid off hundreds of workers and alienated fans. They were mocked and vilified by the tech press What follows is the story of how recorded music clawed its way back. Sherman's account is a playbook of tips for other industries that may soon find themselves in the fight of their lives: SEE ALSO: EU lawmakers vote for new online copyright rules 1. Remember, it may take time to grasp the nature of the threat Napster, the file-sharing service cofounded by Shawn Fanning, launched in June of 1999. Sherman and his staff immediately recognized it as a threat but didn't appreciate how big of a threat it was. \"I think everybody underestimated the speed at which it would grow and the size that it would grow to,\" Sherman tells Business Insider. Before a court ordered Napster shut down in 2001, the service had enabled maybe as many as 8o million people around the world to share countless numbers of songs, free of charge. If a 19-year-old college kid with minimum resources could create a worldwide phenomenon and flip the music industry on its head, what might be accomplished by seasoned technologists who were backed by big bucks? 2. Accept that the competitive threat may evolve, morph and quickly adapt Napster was a centralized peer-to-peer service. A central server indexed the users and their libraries of MP3 song files so others could access them. The music industry had seen earlier, clunkier, and far less popular versions, called File Transfer Protocol technology. \"We started with FTP sites,\" Sherman said. \"Napster was the next form of piracy in 1999 and then a couple of years later came a decentralized form of piracy. Then, came cyber lockers and so onâ¦ each generation of formed piracy had a completely different scale beyond anything we had seen before. And so we saw very quickly that things were spinning out of control.\" 3. Expect your entry barriers and moats to be breached The year before Fanning invented Napster, the big recording companies thought they had piracy-proofed their business thanks in large part to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which outlawed the cracking of anti-piracy protections on CDs and the distribution of pirated songs by Internet services. But the new breed of services let users store music files on their computers, rather than on centralized servers owned by internet providers. That meant that internet service providers weren't liable for the pirated music and it left the record labels with no effective way to stop the problem. The DMCA, the record industry's main bastion of defense against piracy, was \"obsolete within eight months,\" says Sherman."}

Unless Facebook and the government did more to address the threat, Obama warned, it would only get worse in the next presidential race. Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem posed by fake news.

In a statement, the commissioner said that after being notified of its complaint, Facebook responded that it did not have to comply with the body's demand for the information. The commissioner \"considers it necessary to publicly identify Facebook in order to highlight its demonstrated unwillingness to comply with the law, and to inform the New Zealand public of Facebook's position,\" the statement said. The commissioner's statement said \"the social media company said the Privacy Act did not apply to it and it did not have to comply with the Commissioner's request to review the information requested by the complainant.\" The commissioner said its powers beyond demanding information were limited. A spokewoman for Facebook said the company had investigated the complaint but had not been provided enough detail to fully resolve it. \"We are disappointed that the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner asked us to provide access to a year's worth of private data belonging to several people and then criticised us for protecting their privacy,\" she said. \"We scrutinise all requests to disclose personal data, particularly the contents of private messages, and will challenge those that are overly broad...Instead the Commissioner has made a broad and intrusive request for private data.\" Facebook has come into spotlight over the past week over its handling of data from millions of users.

Cambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.

Several executives took to Twitter to insist that the data leak was not technically a \"breach.\" But critics were outraged by the response and accused the company of playing semantics and missing the point. Facebook and its executives faced a torrent of backlash on Saturday following news reports that the data firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on the Trump campaign in 2016, improperly harvested private information from 50 million Facebook users. The company quickly faced calls for increased regulation and oversight, and Massachusetts' Attorney General, Maura Healey, even announced an investigation. \"This is a major breach that must be investigated. It's clear these platforms can't police themselves,\" she said on Twitter. \"I've called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say 'trust us.' Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary.\" But much of the online outrage came after multiple Facebook executives took to Twitter to respond to the news reports, insisting the incident was not a \"data breach.\" \"This was unequivocally not a date breach,\" longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth tweeted. \"People chose to share their data with third party apps and if those third party apps did not follow the data agreements with us/users it is a violation. no systems were infiltrated, no passwords or information were stolen and hacked.\" In a series of tweets that have since been deleted, Facebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, insisted that although user's personal information may have been misused, it wasn't retroactively a \"breach.\" \"The recent Cambridge Analytica stories by the NY Times and The Guardian are important and powerful, but it is incorrect to call this a \"breach\" under any reasonable definition of the term,\" Stamos tweeted. \"We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it.\" Twitter users were not satisfied with that response â many accused the executives of deliberately missing the point by focusing on semantics.

In a statement, Cambridge's board said Nix's comments \"do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.\" Cambridge has denied wrongdoing, and Trump's campaign has said it didn't use Cambridge's data. Facebook also drew continued criticism for its alleged inaction to protect users' privacy. Earlier Tuesday, the chairman of the U.K. parliamentary media committee, Damian Collins, said his group has repeatedly asked Facebook how it uses data. He said Facebook officials \"have been misleading to the committee.\" The committee summoned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify. \"It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,\" Collins wrote Zuckerberg. \"Given your commitment at the start of the New Year to 'fixing' Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.\" Leading Democrats in the U.S. Senate also called on Zuckerberg to testify. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Facebook's latest privacy scandal a \"danger signal.\" She wants Zuckerberg's assurances that Facebook is prepared to take the lead on security measures that protect people's privacy â or Congress may step in. Facebook sidestepped questions on whether Zuckerberg would appear, saying instead that it's currently focused on conducting its own reviews. The request to appear comes as Britain's information commissioner said she was using all her legal powers to investigate the social-media giant and Cambridge Analytica. Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is pursuing a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's servers. She has also asked Facebook to cease its own audit of Cambridge Analytica's data use. \"Our advice to Facebook is to back away and let us go in and do our work,\" she said. Facebook has weathered many such blow-ups before and is used to apologizing and moving on. But the stakes are bigger this time. The latest scandal has some people reconsidering their relationship status with the social network, though there isn't much of anywhere else to go. Cambridge Analytica said it is committed to helping the U.K. investigation. However, Denham's office said the firm failed to meet a deadline to produce the information requested. Denham said the prime allegation against Cambridge Analytica is that it acquired personal data in an unauthorized way, adding that the data provisions act requires services like Facebook to have strong safeguards against misuse of data. Chris Wylie, who once worked for Cambridge Analytica, was quoted as saying the company used the data to build psychological profiles so voters could be targeted with ads and stories. Wylie has agreed to be interviewed by Democrats on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. A date has not been set, and it's unclear if Republicans on the panel will attend. On Tuesday, Wylie said he found Facebook's reaction to the revelations bizarre. He told an audience at the Frontline Club in London that before the story broke, Facebook had agreed to work with him to improve its platform. But he said he was blindsided on Friday with a news release that identified him as a suspect in the case. Cambridge Analytica found itself in further allegations of wrongdoing. Britain's Channel 4 used an undercover investigation to record Nix saying that the company could use unorthodox methods to wage successful political campaigns for clients. In footage released Monday, Nix said the company could \"send some girls\" around to a rival candidate's house, suggesting that girls from Ukraine are beautiful and effective in this role. He also said the company could \"offer a large amount of money\" to a rival candidate and have the whole exchange recorded so it could be posted on the internet to show that the candidate was corrupt. Nix says in a statement that he deeply regrets his role in the meeting and has apologized to staff. \"I am aware how this looks, but it is simply not the case,\" he said. \"I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps', and nor does it use untrue material for any purposes.\" Nix told the BBC that the Channel 4 sting was \"intended to embarrass us\". \"We see this as a coordinated attack by the media that's been going on for very, very many months in order to damage the company that had some involvement with the election of Donald Trump,\" he said. The data harvesting used by Cambridge Analytica has also triggered calls for further investigation from the European Union, as well as federal and state officials in the United States. On Tuesday, a dozen consumer-advocacy organizations pressed the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. to investigate whether the release of data violated an agreement Facebook signed with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances. The move comes after Bloomberg News first reported the FTC could already be investigating. The FTC hasn't confirmed the investigation but said it takes \"any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.\" ___ AP Technology Writers Mae Anderson and Anick Jesdanun in New York and AP writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Richard Lardner in Washington contributed to this story."}

Photograph: Loic Venance/AFP/Getty Images The revelation that 50 million people had their Facebook profiles harvested so Cambridge Analytica could target them with political ads is a huge blow to the social network that raises questions about its approach to data protection and disclosure. Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach Read more As Facebook executives wrangle on Twitter over the semantics of whether this constitutes a âbreachâ, the result for users is the same: personal data extracted from the platform and used for a purpose to which they did not consent. Facebook has a complicated track record on privacy. Its business model is built on gathering data. It knows your real name, who your friends are, your likes and interests, where you have been, what websites you have visited, what you look like and how you speak. It uses all that data to make it super easy for its customers â advertisers â to target you. On the other hand, Facebook very much wants to keep that data â its competitive advantage â to itself, and so guards it carefully. Facebook has yet to face a major hack like Yahoo, Equifax or LinkedIn. So protective is the site of its user data that it makes it very difficult for scholars to study its impact on society. Unfortunately for researchers, the newly reported misappropriation of data is likely to make that even harder. The 50m user profiles were harvested by a Cambridge University researcher, Aleksandr Kogan â separately from his work at the university â but passed to Cambridge Analytica for ad targeting purposes â a violation of Facebook policies. âThis is about a company breaking Facebookâs terms of service and going rogue,â said Sarah T Roberts, a UCLA assistant professor of information studies. âThatâs a pitfall that will exist no matter what policies are implemented. âBut it could be used as an excuse to clamp down on research â especially research thatâs critical.â Catherine Brooks, of the University of Arizonaâs school of information, said: âThis is going to have a chilling effect on Facebookâs motivation to share data with scholars.â The incident could also make it harder for researchers to find people to willing to hand over data. âPeople who consented thought it was for science,â said Casey Fiesler, from the University of Colorado Boulder. âThatâs a really big deal. Will people stop wanting to participate in studies?â It is not clear what the legal implications are for Kogan and Cambridge Analytica, and for Facebook, which discovered the unauthorised use of its data in 2015. Kogan has denied he did anything wrong â so has Cambridge Analytica, which issued a statement on Saturday in which it said it fully complies with Facebookâs terms of service. âFacebook is trying to walk the line between saying that it was not a breach so they arenât liable, but at the same time they are saying that the data use was unauthorised,â said Tiffany Li, resident fellow at Yale Law Schoolâs Information Society Project. âItâs an interesting legal strategy, but whether it will work for them is another question.â"}

A former employee of a Trump-affiliated data-mining firm says it used algorithms that \"took fake news to the next level\" using data inappropriately obtained from Facebook. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus, File) (Thibault Camus) NEW YORK (AP) - A Trump-affiliated firm under scrutiny for inappropriately obtaining data on tens of millions of Facebook users created profiling algorithms that \"took fake news to the next level,\" a former employee said. Chris Wylie said the firm, Cambridge Analytica, secured personal data in order to learn about individuals and then used it to create an information cocoon to change their perceptions. \"This is based on an idea called 'informational dominance,' which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them, you can change their perception of what's actually happening,\" Wylie said. In an interview Monday on NBC's \"Today,\" Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to \"explore mental vulnerabilities of people.\" He said the firm \"works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.\" This idea of \"information dominance,\" of propaganda, Wylie told The Guardian newspaper earlier, is the notion that if you can control all of the streams of information to your opponents, \"you can influence how they perceive that battle space and you can then influence how they're going to behave and react.\" Late Friday, Facebook said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app described as a personality test. Advertisement Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn't disclosed it until now. The developments are the latest to show how people try to exploit Facebook in ways that could sway elections, and in the worst cases even undermine democracy. Before the Cambridge imbroglio, there were Russian agents running election-related propaganda campaigns through targeted ads and fake political events. Wylie claimed Cambridge Analytica used the data it had while speaking with Russian businesses. He also said that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, what's different here is that people wouldn't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views. Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing and said it deleted all data it received from a contractor after learning the data had been obtained in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of that data was used in its 2016 election work for the \"avoidance of doubt.\" President Donald Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data. Wylie left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and it's not clear how the firm targeted people with misinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign. What is clear is that two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center, and about 20 percent do so \"often.\" While people don't exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the \"rabbit hole\" of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described. While Wylie said he doesn't know whether Trump's campaign used the techniques, he said Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was meeting with Cambridge Analytica in 2015, before Trump even announced his run for office.

Facebook has signaled that Zuckerberg will soon testify before Congress about the Cambridge Analytica matter and Facebook’s data protection and privacy policies for its users. WASHINGTON – Facebook has signaled that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress by discussing the details of the appearance with lawmakers, according to a person familiar with the conversations. Three congressional committees have invited Zuckerberg to testify, including the Senate Judiciary Committee at an April 10 meeting about data privacy. It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees. The congressional hearings were prompted by revelations that data consultancy Cambridge Analytica had wrongfully obtained personal information on at least 30 million American Facebook users. Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was “happy to, if it’s the right thing to do.” He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. “What I think we’ve found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I’ll be happy to do it at that point.” On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panel’s leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having “understated the risk” about the data it holds on its users – and whether it had been taken without consent. Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks. In the United States, three congressional committees requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at a hearing in April focused broadly on Silicon Valley’s data privacy practices. But lawmakers so far have not said if they’d take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear. Spokespeople for the three committees – including the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate Commerce Committee – did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday."}

Interested in Facebook? Add Facebook as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Facebook news, video, and analysis from ABC News. A Facebook spokesman confirmed to ABC News that the company received the invitation to appear on April 10, moments before it was shared with the media, and said that it was being âreviewed.â This comes as the Federal Trade Commission â earlier Monday - announced it had opened its own investigation looking into whether or not the tech giant violated a 2011 consent decree it signed promising to protect usersâ privacy. âCompanies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,â the agency wrote in a press release. âAccordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.â Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman said last week of rumors of the FTC action, âWe remain strongly committed to protecting peopleâs information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.â The controversy has roiled company stock, and the announcement Monday of the federal agency probe sent the companyâs stock sliding even further, down nearly four points at its lowest midday trading point. Cambridge Analytica has previously said it was unaware the data was improperly obtained by a third party, and the firm says it cooperated with Facebook in deleting all the social media companyâs data and related information in 2015. Such material was not utilized as part of its work with the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, the data firm said. The Trump campaign has said it never used data from Cambridge Analytica. The Judiciary Committee, for its part, said it plans to cover âprivacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use. It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.â Grassley also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss mounting privacy concerns and âhow to develop ârules of the roadâ that encourage companies to develop tailored approaches to privacy that satisfy consumer expectations while maintaining incentives for innovation.â Pressure is building for Zuckerberg, in particular, to face what will surely be a series of public grillings, as the list of congressional panels demanding his appearance grows. Already, the embattled billionaire businessman has received requests from the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has said it intends to extend an invite, as its panel continues its more than 14-month long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. There are also international demands for Zuckerberg to appear before government panels in the UK, Australia, and beyond. âOn a bipartisan basis, we believe Mr. Zuckerbergâs testimony is necessary to gain a better understanding of how the company plans to restore lost trust, safeguard usersâ data, and end a troubling series of belated responses to serious problems,â Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, said last week in a joint statement. Some in Congress have even begun to threaten regulation of an industry that has long fought against any curb of its activities. âThese tech platforms who are extraordinarily powerful whoâve been great iconic American success stories - they need to be more forthcoming or Washington is going to start imposing rules and regulations that may not fit,â warned Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and, himself, a former tech industry entrepreneur and investor. Warner, who had just months ago insisted on a âlight touchâ to try to press Silicon Valley into action, has seemed to grow more frustrated with the tech CEOâs since last year, when Facebook, Google, and Twitter sent their top lawyers â instead of coming themselves â to the Intelligence panel to testify regarding their role in Russiaâs 2016 interference. âFacebook has -since the beginning of this investigation - have been reluctant, to say the least, to be fully forthcoming,â Warner said, adding, âI think itâs time for the CEO, Mr. Zuckerberg, and other top officials to come and testify and not tell part of the story but tell the whole story of their involvement, not only with the Trump campaign but their ability to have their platform misused by the Russians.â Last Thursday, Facebook sent a handful of senior staff to brief aides to a number of key Senate and House committees on the most recent controversy. The same panels on both sides of Congress who are demanding that Zuckerberg appear also want to hear from Cambridge Analytica executives, including its now-suspended CEO Alexander Nix and former data firm employee Christopher Wylie. The latter told ABC News that he had already accepted House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligenceâs invitation. âOne of the reasons why Iâm speaking out is because I think that itâs really concerning that no one has really investigated Cambridge Analytica and its role in the 2016 election,â Wylie told ABC News in a recent interview. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel, also invited Russian-American researcher Aleksandr Kogan, who developed the initial app approved by Facebook to collect data on 227,000 of its users. Kogan previously told ABC News that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are making him a âscapegoat.â ABC News also reported Monday that Government watchdog group Common Cause filed a pair of legal complaints with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and the Department of Justice accusing Cambridge Analytica LTD, its parent company SCL Group Limited, CEO Alexander Nix, SCL co-founder Nigel Oakes, data scientist Alexander Tayler, and former employee-turned-whistleblower Christopher Wylie of violating federal election laws that prohibit foreigners from participating directly or indirectly in the decision-making process of U.S. political campaigns."}

Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. Cambridge Analytica, a firm that specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages, ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States. The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, âthisisyourdigitallife,â offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as âa research app used by psychologists.â The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had likedÂ and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015. The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted. âWe are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,â the company said. âIf true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.â Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment. The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. âCambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright,Â research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the companyâs systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election. The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers. Facebook said this was standard practice for large political and corporate spenders.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2 Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still donât know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we wonât until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.

Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics â including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5 For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the companyâs poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebookâs settlement.6 Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are â or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data. We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone â including the Trump campaign â who might potentially use this data from Facebookâs platform."}

According to public filings at Britain's Companies House, Emerdata was incorporated in August 2017 and the Mercers were appointed to its board on March 16 this year.

Cambridge Analytica, the Trump campaignâs data firm, harvested private information from more than 50 million unwitting Facebook users in what is being described as one of the largest data breaches in the social media giantâs history. That data âÂ taken without authorization â was used to build a digital operation that guided Trumpâs campaign for the presidency, according to a pair of bombshell reports published Saturday by the New York Times and The Observer of London. The revelation that a firm working for a U.S. presidential candidate stole personal data from millions of Americans has sparked outcry across the country. Within hours of being published, the explosive reports had already prompted at least one state attorney general toÂ launch an investigation into the allegedly fraudulent practices. But Trump, whose campaignÂ paid Cambridge Analytica nearly $6 million for its work, has not said a word about the massive scandal engulfing the data company that the campaign once touted as integral to Trumpâs victory. His silence on the matter raises a host of startling questions, particularly given that he has already started making moves to organize his re-election campaign â and until he says otherwise, itâs reasonable to wonder if he plans to rely on the firm again. The Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016. Jared Kushner, who was in charge of overseeing then-candidate Trumpâs digital operations, brought the data firm into the campaign â a decision that was reportedly cheered on by Steve Bannon, a former vice president of Cambridge Analytica. The data firm, which has always been shrouded in secrecy, later came under scrutiny amid a number of alarming revelations, including a report thatÂ Cambridge Analyticaâs CEO had reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in an effort to obtain Hillary Clintonâs deleted emails. In another instance, Cambridge Analytica reportedly offered to help WikiLeaks organize emails that had been hacked from the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta to make them more accessible to readers. Amid all of these revelations, Trump has remained silent. While his campaign has quietly tried to distance itself from the data firm, no one has given any indication that they have a problem with the allegedly fraudulent â and potentially illegal â practices that were used to help Trump win the presidency. And if Trump doesnât see a problem with the companyâs practices, thereâs no reason to believe that he wonât use them again in 2020 â that is, if special counsel Robert Muellerâs investigation doesnât put an end to them first."}

Larry Sinclair, a 50-something-year-old man, alleged he had sexual relations with Obama in 1999. The story included a limousine, cocaine and a host of other interesting tidbits. There are few reports of the incident because Sinclair could never provide hard evidence, and he has a very long rap sheet. News broke in early January that Trump’s lawyer paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, a large sum in order to keep her affair with the president secret. Michael Cohen, a longtime lawyer for the Trump Organization, was reportedlyÂ the architect of the $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford in October 2016. Clifford alleged the sexual encounter with the president occurred in July 2006, when she and the president met at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. Sinclair is upset at Daniels’ recent press and the fact the media believes her. “Stormy Daniels is being pimped and pimping the media now, and it’s lining her pockets,” Sinclair toldÂ the Washington Examiner. “I believe she had sex with him. Do I believe she’s trying to twist and add to it to benefit her interests? You’re damn right I do.” “I find this whole double standard sickening, and no, I am not a bigger supporter of Trump, but I am a supporter of fair and unbiased media coverage,” Sinclair said. “I find the whole NDA and accepting money and then later coming back and using a completely legal incident for political and personal gain questionable.” The president repeatedly denied having an affair with Daniels but said he did pose for photos with her.

By The Times Editorial Board Mar 20, 2018 | 4:10 AM Facebook logos. (Justin Tallis/ AFP/Getty Images) Reports surfaced this weekend about yet another Facebook-fueled abuse of privacy, this time by an outside company trying to manipulate voters on behalf of political causes and candidates â including Donald J. Trump in 2016. The revelations were both sadly familiar and newly outrageous. According to the Guardian and the New York Times, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan produced an innocuous-looking personality testing app for Facebook whose real purpose was to identify the sorts of marketing pitches one might be susceptible to â ones that played to people's anxieties, for example, or alternatively to their sentiments. He then gathered data not just from the roughly 270,000 people who used the app, but from tens of millions of their Facebook friends, all without the friends' knowledge or consent, according to the news articles. Advertisement Whether the consent decree that Facebook signed in 2011 will have any bearing on this latest privacy affront remains to be seen. Share quote & link The story gets worse, however. Kogan reportedly turned over the Facebook data he had harvested to a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, to help it build profiles that it could use to sway voters on a massive scale. The messages could be tailored precisely to the weaknesses of a narrow group of voters, and each pitch could be confined to a single group to avoid putting off voters with different sensibilities. As Christopher Wylie, who worked at Cambridge Analytica from its founding until 2014, told the Guardian, \"We would know what kinds of messages you would be susceptible to, and where you're going to consume that. And then how many times do we need to touch you with that in order to change how you think about something.\" Political campaigns and commercial advertisers have long sought to target their pitches; what's different now is how the internet and enormously popular platforms such as Facebook make the process easier, more effective, wider-scale and far more intrusive. Cambridge Analytica has denied using Facebook data improperly, but news reports over the weekend strongly suggest that the firm built its profiles at least in part with data Facebook users didn't realize they were sharing with it. Kogan insists that he, too, did nothing wrong, and that's one of the most disturbing elements of the story. One reason he could acquire all that data about his app users' Facebook friends, including their posts and their likes, is because Facebook opened that information to application developers in 2011. The company rolled back access to information about app users' friends in 2015, long after Kogan harvested and shared that data. Facebook says that when it first learned about Kogan's data sharing in 2015, it instructed his company and Cambridge Analytica to destroy the harvested data. If the latest news reports are true, a Facebook executive told the Guardian, \"it's a serious abuse\" of the company's rules. That's little comfort to the millions of people whose marketing susceptibilities have now been cataloged with Facebook's help. And this is just the latest in a long line of privacy problems at the social network. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission entered into a settlement with the company in 2011 over misleading or false disclosures to users about app developers' access to data, among other issues. Whether the consent decree that Facebook signed in 2011 will have any bearing on this latest privacy affront remains to be seen. Regardless, the fundamental problem here is that companies keep finding new and unanticipated ways to use the personal information people share online â including the digital bread crumbs they leave unwittingly as they wander around the web. Are you comfortable knowing that companies are scooping up your crumbs, your \"likes,\" your tweets, your status updates and your lists of friends to determine whether to offer you discounts? To decide which news items to show you? To determine how best to sell you on a controversial presidential candidate or a costly ballot measure? The largely hands-off approach taken by regulators to date has encouraged bountiful innovation and experimentation, but it's also reinforced an act-first, ask-forgiveness-later mentality among entrepreneurs. The only guidelines are the vaguely worded prohibitions in federal law against unfair and deceptive practices; rather than trying to adopt comprehensive guidelines, the Federal Trade Commission has handled complaints on a case-by-case basis. It's not enough. Internet users need some measure of control over the information they reveal online, so that they are not unwittingly helping countless unseen data brokers, aggregators and analysts find new and better ways to steer their opinions, purchases and votes. A federal bill of rights covering online data would be a good place to start. How many outrages have to surface before the tech industry and the federal government start taking privacy seriously?"}

Though both companies have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, this weekendâs demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either nation. âThey say âtrust us,â but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order toÂ targetÂ political advertising and manipulate voters,â Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill. âI think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,â Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming. âI will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,â Collins said in his statement. âIt is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.â VÄra JourovÃ¡, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as âhorrifying, if confirmed,â in a tweet.Â Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek âfurther clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.â Facebook declined to comment on theÂ calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts toÂ investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica. âWe are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information,â said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement. Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform â especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race â has intensified. He hasÂ written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch. And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter. âSometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps theyâre above the rules that apply to everybody else,â Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBCâs âMeet the Press.â The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of aÂ Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as âa research app used by psychologists.â It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users â including the names of users, their âlikes,â friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests. Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab.Â Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data. âWe worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebookâs terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,â Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday. Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way. Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a âbreachâ of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially. In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook âfriendâ data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the companyâs systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so. But the idea of a âbreachâ seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a âmajor breach.â Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is itsÂ 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines. In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, âWe reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.â Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling. âThe recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,â said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. âFacebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.â U.S. lawmakers last fallÂ questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spreadÂ disinformationÂ during the 2016 election. The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russiaâs role in the election. In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about âfake newsâ and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain'sÂ vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation. One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebookâs relationship with its usersâ personal data âreminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.â At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca PowÂ questioned whether Facebook was a âmassive surveillance operation.â In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.

The countryâs government and lawmakers in the lower house of parliament are seeking information on whether Germany users were affected in the scandal that saw Cambridge Analytica, an election consulting firm siphoning data from tens of millions of Facebook users. Facebook has come under sustained criticism following reports that Cambridge Analytica used data to help build an election-consulting company. The company has even bragged it could influence votes around the world.Â According to reports, about 270,000 users authorized an academic to use their information for research purposes, but the researcher allegedly violated privacy rules when he handed the data off to the advertising firm. On Friday, addressing a news conference, Justice and Consumer Protection ministry spokeswoman Josephine Steffen said that the minister Katarina Barley has summoned Facebook officials to a meeting in Berlin on Monday. She said that the meeting will be attended by officials including Richard Allen, Facebook vice president of policy for the EMEA region. Steffen said, âWe will talk to the representatives of Facebook, we will also ask if German users are affected, how this came about and what Facebook intends to do in the future so that it wonât happen again.â Steffen said that the Justice and Consumer Protection minister has pointed out that Facebook users must know exactly what happens to their personal information before allowing it to be harvested.Â She added that fines of as much as 4 percent of global annual sales can be levied from May under a European data protection law. Further, Stephan Harbarth, a deputy leader of Chancellor Angela Merkelâs Christian Democrat-led bloc in parliament,Â added that the government will consider legal action to force social network operators to better protect privacy. A report in Handelsblatt newspaper quoted a committee member Thomas Jarzombek as saying that Merkelâs CDU is planning to invite Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to speak to the Bundestagâs committee on the digital agenda."}

Photo: Alex Wong Facebook is under fire on two continents. Following weekend reports that Cambridge Analytica was able to harvest private information from tens of millions of Facebook users without those users receiving an alert from the social network, Facebook needs to stop denying its failures and start fixing them. Cambridge Analytica is a political data firm owned by conservative billionaire Robert Mercer and headed at the time of the breach by Steve Bannon, a former top adviser to President Trump. In 2014, Global Science Research paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app that scraped private information from their profiles and those of their friends’. The company told Facebook it was collecting the information for academic research. Instead, it shared the information with Cambridge Analytica, which went on to run data analytics for President Trump’s presidential campaign. More on Facebook Facebook has responded to the backlash by suspending Cambridge Analytica — as well as data expert Christopher Wylie, who blew the whistle on the misuse of data — from its platform. That’s not good enough. In both Britain and the United States, lawmakers are demanding answers from Facebook about how this happened. The company’s lack of disclosure may be a violation of the laws in both countries. The Massachusetts attorney general has opened an investigation, and more states are sure to follow. The company’s role in this misuse of data is sure to encourage more countries to consider adopting a wide-ranging set of personal data protections, like the ones the European Union will begin enforcing in May. (Assemblyman Marc Levine, D-San Rafael, has introduced AB2182 to establish a data protection agency for California.) Technology companies, including Facebook, dislike these kinds of privacy protections. The hard truth is that social networks rely on data mining to build advertising revenues and other critical aspects of their business models. User information may be highly profitable — but it can also be used for all kinds of nefarious purposes, including psychological manipulation. If social networks don’t start taking these kinds of abuses more seriously, they’ll have to find a new way to do business. This commentary is from The Chronicle’s editorial board.

FILE PHOTO - Mukhisa Kituyi, Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, speaks during the Nigeria/Ecowas Trade and Investment for Development forum in Abuja, Nigeria November 2, 2017. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde Facebook has faced a global outcry and its shares have slid in value after a whistleblower said data from millions of users was improperly harvested by consultancy Cambridge Analytica to target U.S. and British voters. “The current debate about Facebook and data privacy vividly illustrates that most countries are ill-prepared for the digital economy,” UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said in a statement. Data privacy is just one of many boxes that national regulators need to tick if they hope to get a handle on e-commerce, UNCTAD’s head of internet and computer technology analysis TorbjÃ¶rn Fredriksson told a news conference. “Then you look at trade logistics, especially to try to address what we call the tsunami of parcels, when people start ordering from online platforms instead of going to the retail shop that has bought everything in bulk,” he said. In developing countries, internet purchases are still mainly paid for with cash on delivery, and central banks and finance ministries need to help ensure access to online payment systems, Fredriksson added. But most developing countries are still unclear about whose job it is to coordinate e-commerce, he said. Without online payments, local firms would struggle to export on international e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba, while the flood of imports risks creating a trade imbalance. “There is some concern that ... there is a risk of concentration of markets among the big platforms,” Fredriksson said, adding that UNCTAD was working on ways to address the problem. Although rich countries are thinking about how they need to adapt, poorer countries are largely flying blind, with no data for example on e-commerce circumventing national trade rules, which could help the traffic in counterfeit goods. “There are concerns about jobs that may be lost, taxation, customs revenue, there’s a whole range of issues that are challenges more than opportunities perhaps,” Fredriksson said. “Governments are increasingly looking at it, but whether they are looking at it enough is another issue.”"}

In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the company’s vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to “the public prominence of this organization.” Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of “a research app used by psychologists.” Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to users’ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about users’ friends. While Kogan’s method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebook’s policies, “he did not subsequently abide by our rules,” Grewal stated in the Facebook post. “By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.” Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action — apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information. Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie. Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica eitherÂ played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential electionÂ or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analytica’s so-called secret sauce as “exaggerated” in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaks’ Julian Assange with an offer to helpÂ disseminate Hillary Clinton’s controversial missing emails. In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign). …We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trumpâs campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didnât have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (itâs probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as Iâve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly thereâs psychographic data thatâs baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because weâre not reinventing the wheel. [Weâve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and weâve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didnât have time. We just couldnât do that. The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015. The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebook’s approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform. Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadn’t figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena. “Thereâs no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,” Nix told TechCrunch last year. “…There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which weâre taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.” Responding to the allegations, Cambridge Analytica sent the following statement. In 2014, SCL Elections contracted Dr. Kogan via his company Global Science Research (GSR) to undertake a large scale research project in the US. GSR was contractually committed to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR were also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. The language in the SCL Elections contract with GSR is explicit on these points. GSR subsequently obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebookâs terms of service, SCL Elections deleted all data it had received from GSR. For the avoidance of doubt, no data from GSR was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election. Under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act (Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data), a criminal offense has not been committed if a person has acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain data. GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections illegally acquired Facebook data. Indeed SCL Elections worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that SCL Elections had not knowingly breached any of Facebookâs Terms of Service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted. Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections do not use or hold Facebook data."}

Read the latest.) LONDON â As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem. The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social networkâs history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trumpâs campaign in 2016. An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analyticaâs drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm â and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics â under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic. Image Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firmâs activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: âRules donât matter for them. For them, this is a war, and itâs all fair.â âThey want to fight a culture war in America,â he added. âCambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.â Details of Cambridgeâs acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firmâs so-called psychographic modeling techniques. But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed â and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firmâs emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove. Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action. âThis was a scam â and a fraud,â Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. âWe will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all â and take action against all offending parties,â Mr. Grewal said. Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebookâs rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the âBrexitâ campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was âillegally acquired and used.â In the United States, Mr. Mercerâs daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees. Image The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the companyâs role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Departmentâs special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election. While the substance of Mr. Muellerâs interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firmâs British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trumpâs Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on usersâ identities, friend networks and âlikes.â Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party. âProtecting peopleâs information is at the heart of everything we do,â Mr. Grewal said. âNo systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.â Still, he added, âitâs a serious abuse of our rules.â Reading Votersâ Minds The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate. Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obamaâs campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect votersâ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University. The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said. Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth. Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift Americaâs culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment. Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginiaâs gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward. The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win. When Mr. Wylieâs colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email. âITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??â he wrote. Mr. Wylieâs team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior. But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages. Image Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data. Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge Universityâs Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew â a claim that has been disputed. When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs â more than $800,000 â and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records. All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was âa very standard vanilla Facebook app.â He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million â a number previously reported by The Intercept â contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users â those who participated in the survey â had consented to having their data harvested. Image An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted. Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was âthe saving graceâ that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers. âWe wanted as much as we could get,â he acknowledged. âWhere it came from, who said we could have it â we werenât really asking.â Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Koganâs contributions as âfruitless.â An International Effort Just as Dr. Koganâs efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCLâs elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylieâs team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica. The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European. But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections. In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself âfrom substantive managementâ of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, âto manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.â In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all âpersonnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.â Mr. Nix ânever had any strategic or operational roleâ in an American election campaign, the company said. Whether the companyâs American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employeesâ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules. Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees. Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trumpâs digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support. Image The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters. Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firmâs profiles helped shape Mr. Trumpâs strategy â statements disputed by other campaign officials â but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters. In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on âlegacy psychographicsâ built for the Cruz campaign. After the Leak By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former âcontractorsâ as engaging in âwhat is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.â Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was âcarefully investigating this situationâ and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it. Facebook verified the leak and â without publicly acknowledging it â sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. âThis data was obtained and used without permission,â said a letter that was obtained by the Times. âIt cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.â Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and âSCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.â Image Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook usersâ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social networkâs history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebookâs control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted. Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations. All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analyticaâs political business. No American campaigns or âsuper PACsâ have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trumpâs re-election campaign. In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age â a âMath Man,â he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on.

You arrive, hoping you might see familiar faces, but all the other gamblers are people you don't give a crap about. You shrug and head to a slot machine. You crank the lever for the thousandth time, cross your fingers and hope for a win. Surprise: You're still a loser. But you'll be back in an hour -- maybe your luck will change. If you're thinking, \"I want that! Help!\" you've come to the right place. Step 1: Stop over-thinking it Worried about losing touch with old friends? Don't. If you were actually friends -- not mutual stalkers -- you would be chatting over a cup of coffee right now. What about networking? I get it, you don't want to talk to someone you met at a work function over the phone. Here are some other modern options for you: texting and email. (Whew, that was a close one.) And all those groups you're in? Well, there are simply some things you're going to have to give up. Think about the trade-off -- you're getting an hour per day (on average) back. That's 365 hours per year. That's a lot of hours over the course of a lot of years. You're welcome. But I use messenger! Not sure if you've heard but most people have a phone number that you can send text messages to. There's also WhatsApp. (Also, you can deactivate your account and still use Messenger. More on that later.) Step 2: Disconnect those apps (like Spotify) You've probably used Facebook to log into other apps and services dozens of times. And why not? It makes signing up for new things super fast. Problem is, those logins inadvertently burrowed you deeper into Facebook's grasp. It's reversible, but it'll require some time to undo. Here's how: Make a list of all the apps you log into using Facebook. One way to figure this out is to go to Facebook (desktop) > Settings > Apps. Scroll through this list and make note of the apps and websites you still use. One by one, log into those apps. Visit the Settings page and find the option to disconnect from Facebook. This process varies quite a bit, so you might want to Google \"disconnect Facebook from [insert app here]\" to speed things up. It was once nearly impossible to disconnect Facebook from Spotify, but the company recently made it much easier. In Spotify, go to Settings and choose the option to disconnect from Facebook. Now log off. In the login window, hit \"Reset Password.\" Follow the instructions, and you're golden. Step 3: Download all your memories You probably want to keep all your photos, posts, friends and all the other data you accumulated on Facebook. Luckily, saving all that data is really easy. Go to Facebook (desktop) and head to Settings. In that first window, hit \"Download a copy of your Facebook data.\" Follow the instructions and wait while Facebook emails you a downloadable file. Now playing:Watch this: How to download your Facebook data 2:14 Step 4: Delete, deactivate or detach This is the part where boys become men. Girls become women. Caterpillars become... you get the idea. You have three options when it comes to quitting Facebook: Permanently delete your account. This is irreversible -- all your data will be removed, your profile will disappear and you'll need to sign up for Facebook again if you want back in. Deactivate your account. This option is for people who know that, eventually, they'll succumb to their addiction. Deactivating essentially puts your account on hold, so you can restore it to the same state it was in when you left it. This also lets you continue using Facebook Messenger. Detach yourself. I really don't recommend this one. There are very few people in this world who have enough self-control to forgo deleting or deactivating their account in favor of ignoring Facebook. But if your addiction is mild or you were never really into Facebook anyway, this option could work for you. To permanently delete your account, go to this page. To deactivate your account, go here. Just be warned, Facebook uses a weird combination of psychology and desperation to try and prevent you from quitting. If you plan to detach yourself and use self-control to \"quit\" Facebook, here are some tips: Opt out of Facebook's email notifications Minimize your profile by making your Timeline, photos and anything else you can private"}

The Senate Judiciary Committee, the Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general from 37 states and territories were among the parties advancing or confirming probes into Facebook on Monday. They all want more information on the company's knowledge and handling of Trump-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica's reported acquisition and exploitation of data from 50 million Facebook users. Zuckerberg will be asked about \"Facebook's past and future policies regarding the protection and monitoring of consumer data,\" according to a statement from the committee. The House and Senate Commerce committees have already invited Zuckerberg to testify at hearings of their own. Running concurrent with Capitol Hill's pressure on Zuckerberg is an investigation into Facebook by the country's chief consumer protection regulator. The FTC on Monday confirmed that probe. \"Companies who have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC order provisions imposing privacy and data security requirements,\" Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC's consumer protection bureau, said in a statement. \"Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has an open non-public investigation into these practices.â In 2011, Facebook entered into a consent decree with the FTC over its privacy practices. The company could face astronomical fines if the FTC finds that it violated that agreement. A source familiar with the matter told POLITICO last week that the FTC had launched an inquiry into Facebook. The top cops from 34 states, plus two territories and Washington, D.C., moved their own inquiries forward Monday in a joint letter to Zuckerberg. \"The situation involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raises significant concerns about Facebook's policies and practices relating to user privacy, as well as the truthfulness and clarity of representations made to users concerning the uses of their data,\" Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen wrote in the letter. The attorneys general, a mix of Republicans and Democrats, \"take this very seriously and are collectively engaging Facebook to get to the bottom of what happened and to ensure that these privacy concerns are addressed,\" Jepsen said. The AGs in their letter request answers from Zuckerberg to a raft of questions. Those include how Facebook monitored developers' use of data; what safeguards were in place to ensure data wasn't being misused; which apps could access the data of unsuspecting Facebook users; and when Facebook learned of the Cambridge \"breach of privacy protections.\""}

Cambridge Analytica was suspended on Friday after reports that it had not fully deleted data it obtained from Cambridge University professor Aleksandr Kogan. The professor was found to have harvested more than 50 million Facebook profiles from his app, which required a Facebook login, despite only 270,000 having given permission for their data to be harvested, according to a New York Times report Saturday. About thirty million of the profiles Kogan gave the firm had enough information to create psychographic profiles, the newspaper reported. Facebook said discovered that the firm had violated its rules in 2015 and demanded that the firm certify it had destroyed the data it had received. The firm provided the certification. However, Facebook said it suspended the firm after recent reports came out that said Cambridge Analytica did not destroy all of its data. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information,\" Facebook Vice President Paul Grewal said in a statement issued Friday. \"Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies,\" the statement read. Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its involvement in the 2016 presidential election. President Trump's former strategist and chief campaign executive Steve Bannon was a former vice president of the firm. Special counsel Robert Mueller has reportedly requested all the emails between the firm and the Trump campaign and the firm's CEO has been reportedly interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee."}

Photograph: Paul Zinken/EPA The revelation that Cambridge Analytica exploited the data of 50 million Facebook profiles to target American voters is indeed frightening. But Cambridge Analytica shouldnât act as a diversion from the real bad guy in this story: Facebook. It is mystifying that as his company regulates the flow of information to billions of human beings, encouraging certain purchasing habits and opinions, and monitoring peopleâs interactions, Mark Zuckerberg is invited to give lectures at Harvard without being treated with due scepticism. We have now reached the point where an unaccountable private corporation is holding detailed data on over a quarter of the worldâs population. Zuckerberg and his company have been avoiding responsibility for some time. Governments everywhere need to get serious in how they deal with Facebook. After trolls were sent to jail for sending threatening messages to the activist Caroline Criado-Perez and MP Stella Creasy, a debate ensued over whether the likes of Facebook and Twitter should be classified as platforms or publishers. Facebook is treated as if it is simply a conduit for information, meaning it is not liable for the content its users share â in the same way that BT canât be sued when people make threatening phone calls. In 2014 Iain MacKenzie, a spokesperson for Facebook, said, âEvery piece of content on Facebook has an associated âreportâ option that escalates it to your user operations team for review. Additionally, individuals can block anyone who is harassing them, ensuring they will be unable to interact further. Facebook tackles malicious behaviour through a combination of social mechanisms and technological solutions appropriate for a mass-scale online opportunity.â But the company is evasive about the number of moderators it employs, how they work, and how decisions are made. It has started taking a firmer line on far-right content â recently removing Britain First pages from the site â but it is still resisting many legislative attempts to regulate its content. What content users then see is decided by an algorithm that can change without any consultation, including with the government or the businesses that rely on Facebook for revenue â meaning that some can be quickly wiped off the map. In February 2018 the website Digiday reported on LittleThings, a four-year-old site that shut down overnight after Facebook decided to prioritise user posts over publisher content. A hundred jobs were lost. Facebook wasnât the only contributor to LittleThingsâ demise, but those working at the website said there was nowhere else to go after the algorithm change. And this isnât the only example: in 2013 an algorithm change halved the traffic of viral content website Upworthy â something from which the website has never recovered. The impact of Facebookâs dominance means that publications are constantly scrambling to keep up with the platformâs changing strategy. The editor-in-chief of Wired, Nick Thompson, recently told the Digiday podcast that there was a fear âFacebook has a dial somewhere that can be turned to cut off media that gets too uppityâ. Much has been made of the fact that Facebook creates âfilter bubblesâ. It has been criticised for prioritising content that users will like â meaning there is less diversity in the news stories people read â and for failing to crack down on propaganda. In fact, Italyâs new far-right star Matteo Salvini explicitly thanked Facebook for contributing to the countryâs recent election results. All this from a company that in 2016 paid just Â£5.1m in corporation tax on its UK operations, despite profit and revenues nearly quadrupling on the back of increased advertising sales. In December 2017, Facebook announced it would start booking advertising revenue in countries where it was earned, instead of rerouting it via Ireland, although â as this newspaper reported â the move is âunlikely to result in it paying much more taxâ. This is despite Zuckerberg calling for governments to start paying a universal basic income for every citizen as a response to automation, driven in part by Silicon Valley. Even if we want to avoid the site and keep our data protected, itâs not as easy as one might think. According to Roger McNamee, an early investor in Facebook, the company uses techniques found in propaganda and casino gambling to foster psychological addiction in its users â such as constant notifications and variable rewards. By keeping us hooked, Facebook is able to hold a huge amount of data on us. What is surprising, and worrying, is the derived data Facebook has â the profiles it can build of its users based on seemingly innocuous information. The author of the book Networks of Control, Wolfie Christl, noted that a patent published by Facebook works out peopleâs commute times by using location data from mobile apps. It then uses this and other data to segregate users into social classes. Facebookâs massive data cache goes hand in hand with its acquisition of competitors. Nick Srnicek, author of Platform Capitalism, says, âFacebook is acting like a classic monopoly: itâs buying up competitors like Instagram, itâs blatantly copying rivals like Snapchat, and it even has its own app, Onavo, that acts to warn them of potential threats. All of this is combined with an unchecked sweeping up of our data thatâs being used to build an impervious moat around its business.â If ExxonMobil attempted to insert itself into every element of our lives like this, there might be a concerted grassroots movement to curb its influence. So perhaps itâs time to start treating Facebook as the giant multinational corporation it is â especially because people with Facebook profiles arenât the companyâs customers: they are the product it sells to advertisers."}

Read the latest.) LONDON â As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem. The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social networkâs history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trumpâs campaign in 2016. An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analyticaâs drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm â and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics â under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic. Image Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firmâs activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: âRules donât matter for them. For them, this is a war, and itâs all fair.â âThey want to fight a culture war in America,â he added. âCambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.â Details of Cambridgeâs acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firmâs so-called psychographic modeling techniques. But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed â and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firmâs emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove. Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action. âThis was a scam â and a fraud,â Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. âWe will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all â and take action against all offending parties,â Mr. Grewal said. Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebookâs rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the âBrexitâ campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was âillegally acquired and used.â In the United States, Mr. Mercerâs daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees. Image The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the companyâs role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Departmentâs special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election. While the substance of Mr. Muellerâs interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firmâs British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trumpâs Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on usersâ identities, friend networks and âlikes.â Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party. âProtecting peopleâs information is at the heart of everything we do,â Mr. Grewal said. âNo systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.â Still, he added, âitâs a serious abuse of our rules.â Reading Votersâ Minds The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate. Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obamaâs campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect votersâ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University. The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said. Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth. Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift Americaâs culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment. Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginiaâs gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward. The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win. When Mr. Wylieâs colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email. âITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??â he wrote. Mr. Wylieâs team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior. But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages. Image Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data. Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge Universityâs Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew â a claim that has been disputed. When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs â more than $800,000 â and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records. All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was âa very standard vanilla Facebook app.â He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million â a number previously reported by The Intercept â contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users â those who participated in the survey â had consented to having their data harvested. Image An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted. Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was âthe saving graceâ that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers. âWe wanted as much as we could get,â he acknowledged. âWhere it came from, who said we could have it â we werenât really asking.â Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Koganâs contributions as âfruitless.â An International Effort Just as Dr. Koganâs efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCLâs elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylieâs team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica. The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European. But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections. In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself âfrom substantive managementâ of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, âto manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.â In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all âpersonnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.â Mr. Nix ânever had any strategic or operational roleâ in an American election campaign, the company said. Whether the companyâs American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employeesâ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules. Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees. Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trumpâs digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support. Image The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters. Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firmâs profiles helped shape Mr. Trumpâs strategy â statements disputed by other campaign officials â but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters. In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on âlegacy psychographicsâ built for the Cruz campaign. After the Leak By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former âcontractorsâ as engaging in âwhat is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.â Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was âcarefully investigating this situationâ and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it. Facebook verified the leak and â without publicly acknowledging it â sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. âThis data was obtained and used without permission,â said a letter that was obtained by the Times. âIt cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.â Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and âSCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.â Image Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook usersâ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social networkâs history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebookâs control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted. Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations. All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analyticaâs political business. No American campaigns or âsuper PACsâ have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trumpâs re-election campaign. In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age â a âMath Man,â he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on.

Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) NEW YORK (AP) â Facebook is giving its privacy tools a makeover as it reels from criticisms over its data practices and faces tighter European regulations in the coming months. The changes won't affect Facebook's privacy policies or the types of data it gathers on users. But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. Facebook says it also wants to give users a simpler way to access and download the data it collects on them. Wednesday's announcement follows revelations that a President Trump-affiliated consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, got data on millions of Facebook users. That included information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing. In addition, Facebook is also facing widespread criticism for collecting years of contact names, telephone numbers and call and text histories from Android users. The company has not said exactly what it used such data for or why it needed it. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it is investigating Facebook over its privacy practices. Facebook's chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, said in a blog post that most of the privacy updates have been in the works for \"some time, but the events of the past several days underscore their importance.\" Facebook also said it plans to update its privacy policy and terms of service in the coming weeks, but gave no further details. The company has tried over the years to simplify its privacy settings, yet the controls remain hard to find and use for many people. For example, Facebook announced in 2009 that it was consolidating six privacy pages and more than 30 settings on to a single privacy page. Yet mobile users still had to go to nearly 20 different places to access all of their privacy controls. Now, Facebook says they will be accessible from a single place. Facebook says it is also adding \"clearer explanations\" about how its privacy controls work. Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, called the new settings \"the first of many steps\" the company is taking to address privacy concerns. Facebook has been working on the changes in preparation for the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which were approved two years ago and take effect May 25. The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to give and withdraw consent for the use of their data. They apply to any company that collects data on EU residents, no matter where it is based. To comply with this, Facebook is adding a section called \"access your information,\" a secure way for users to manage data they've shared with the company, including status updates, comments and things they have searched for. That's where people can go to delete information or download a copy. While this download was already possible, it took some time to figure out how to do it. Cox said the changes let people browse through their information in detail, without having to download it. For example, users will now be able to look up a post from a specific date in the past. Cox said that while the changes are \"in line with the principle of GDPR,\" there's also a \"bunch of stuff that goes above and beyond that.\" ABC7's Lindsey Mastis shows us how to use the new privacy settings on Facebook Live.

The Facebook founder has been called to give evidence to the digital, culture, media and sport committee after revelations over the use of its data by the election consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The company has also come under the spotlight in the US after an investigation by the Observer, Channel 4 News and the New York Times revealed that 50m user profiles had been accessed and harvested for data. In a letter to Zuckerberg, the committeeâs chair, Damian Collins, wrote that Facebook had been repeatedly asked about how companies acquired and held on to user data from its site, and whether data had been taken without usersâ consent. âYour officialsâ answers have consistently understated this risk and have been misleading to the committee,â he wrote. âIt is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process â¦ Given your commitment at the start of the new year to âfixingâ Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.â The committee said Facebook had failed to provide follow-up evidence after the last hearing and that this weekâs revelations had raised new questions for the inquiry. On Wednesday it will take evidence from a former Facebook operations manager, Sandy Parakilas. The letter gave a deadline of 26 March for a response. In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name. Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic âwarâ on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit. She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britainâs Electoral Commission and the Information Commissionerâs Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analyticaâs use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics. While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players. The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a âtextbook example of bad journalismâ. But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience. Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates. Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Muellerâs probing of the companyâs role in Donald Trumpâs presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live. A White House spokesman said Donald Trump would welcome investigations into the breach. âThe president believes that Americansâ privacy should be protected. You know, if Congress wants to look into the matter or other agencies want to look into the matter, we welcome that,â the deputy press secretary Raj Shah told Fox News. âWithout knowing the specifics, itâs difficult to tell whether an individual should testify but we do support the privacy of American citizens.â The company issued a statement on Tuesday saying it was outraged at the developments. The statement said: â[CEO] Mark [Zuckerberg], [COO] Sheryl [Sandberg] and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of this issue. âThe entire company is outraged we were deceived. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.â The companyâs stock market stockâs woes continued on Tuesday, as the share price dropped 3.5% to drop to around 17% below last monthâs all-time high, The inquiries followed revelations of how data from Facebook was deployed by Cambridge Analytica (CA) without usersâ consent, and of boasts by CA to undercover reporters about the role it could play in political campaigns. The UKâs information commissioner has announced her intention to investigate CA, but on Tuesday she was still awaiting a warrant to enter its central London offices. A Huffington Post reporter said he had seen about 10 crates of documents being removed from the building, which is shared with other tenants. The Information Commissionerâs Office (ICO) said it wasnât responsible for removing any files. Crates filled with documents have been seen being removed from the same building as Cambridge Analytica's HQ. Their provenance cannot be verified. A delivery person did not answer questions, while a van driver said: \"No comment\". pic.twitter.com/mBPEYZxmQw The commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, said she had also demanded that Facebook halt an data audit of CA which had commenced, saying it could prejudice her investigation. Cybersecurity consultants from Stroz Friedberg, who had been engaged by Facebook to do the audit, were at CAâs office in London on Monday evening when the ICO asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue their own investigation. Collins said it was extraordinary that Facebookâs investigators had been in the CA office, and he questioned their motives. âWe were told this last night and I donât think the information commissioner was aware of that at that time,â he told the BBC. âThis is a matter for the authorities. Facebook sent in data analysts and lawyers who they appointed; what they intended to do there, who knows? âThe concern would have been: were they removing information or evidence which could have been vital to the investigation? Itâs right they stood down but itâs astonishing they were there in the first place.â In a statement on Tuesday, CA said it had been in touch with the Information Commissionerâs Office since February 2017, when it had hosted its team in its London office. âSince early last year we have subsequently cooperated with the ICO on multiple lines of inquiry, including most recently on the Facebook data and derivatives that we received from GSR, the research company that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research. âOn this point we have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection.â"}

But thousands of other developers, including the makers of games such as FarmVille and the dating app Tinder, as well as political consultants from President Barack Obamaâs 2012 presidential campaign, also siphoned huge amounts of data about users and their friends, developing deep understandings of peopleâs relationships and preferences. Cambridge Analytica â unlike other firms that access Facebookâs user data â broke Facebookâs rules by obtaining the data under the pretense of academic use. But experts familiar with Facebookâs systems and policies say that the greater problem was that the rules for accessing the social networkâs information trove were so loose in the first place. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in 2007 invited outside developers to build their businesses off Facebookâs data, giving them ready access to the friend lists, âlikesâ and affinities that connect millions of Facebook users. Practically any engineer who could persuade a Facebook user to download an app or to sign into a website using Facebookâs popular âlog-in through Facebookâ feature would have been able to access not only the profile, behavior and location of that Facebook user but also that of all the userâs Facebook friends, developers said. Such information can be extremely valuable to marketers and political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. As long as the developers didnât misrepresent themselves, Facebook allowed the data to be stored on developersâ databases in perpetuity. Facebook changed its policy in 2015 after concerns about misuse of data by third parties and a shift in strategy tied to its relationships with developers. The question of what Facebook permitted â and how everyday users understood those permissions â is under a new spotlight in the wake of the Cambridge revelations. In that case, the 270,000 people who downloaded an app authorized an academic working with Cambridge Analytica to collect their data. But Cambridge Analytica was able to vacuum up data from millions more people, analysts estimate, without their permission through the friends lists of the initial group. On Monday, Facebook said it will audit Cambridge Analytica to determine whether the company had deleted the data it took inappropriately. Cambridge Analytica did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Over the weekend, the firm said it âfully complies with Facebookâs terms of service.â Congressional calls for Facebook officials to testify on Capitol Hill grew louder and more bipartisan Monday as lawmakers demanded that the tech giant explain how Cambridge Analytica obtained its data. The increasingly sharp and personal tenor of the requests, many of which sought an appearance by Zuckerberg, raised the odds of a fresh round of potentially contentious hearings â after Facebook defended itself in fall hearings about Russian maÂ­nipuÂ­laÂ­tion of its site connected to the 2016 election. âWhile Facebook has pledged to enforce its policies to protect peopleâs information, questions remain as to whether those policies are sufficient and whether Congress should take action to protect peopleâs private information,â Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) wrote in a joint letter to Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. A spokesman for Grassley said the senator had not decided whether to hold a hearing. Facebookâs shares closed down 6.8Â percent on Monday, at their lowest price in several weeks. Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through a psychological testing app, called ThisisÂ­yourdigitallife, that offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as âa research app used by psychologists.â Facebook said 270,000 people downloaded the app. That allowed the collection of data on 50 million âfriends,â the New York Times and the Observer of London have reported. âFacebook made it easy for app developers to collect usersâ friendsâ data,â said Nick Soman, an entrepreneur who collected the locations of Facebook usersâ friends to enhance his social app LikeBright, which no longer exists. Facebook did not conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica in 2015 when the violations were first discovered, according to Facebook. Instead, it asked Cambridge, the psychologists and an affiliate company to promise it would delete the ill-gotten information. âThe model was to build and grow and figure out monetization,â said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook operations manager who oversaw developersâ privacy practices until 2012. âProtecting users did not fit into that.â Parakilas, as well as a contractor who worked on these issues at Facebook until 2016, said that Facebook did not conduct a single audit of developers during their tenures. The Federal Trade Commission and European regulators had reviewed and were familiar with the companyâs data policies at the time, Facebook said Monday. The company says that any user who downloaded an app or used the sign-on feature had to agree to a permissions screen that said, âThis app will receive the following info: your public profile, friend list, birthday, groups, current city, photos, and personal description and your friendsâs birthdays, photos, and likes.â But two former FTC officials said that Facebookâs allowing the psychologist to take so much data about a personâs friends could constitute a violation of a 2011 consent decree with the agency. Under that agreement, Facebook is required to notify and get explicit permissions from users before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings that they have established. The fines for breaking the consent decree are $40,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars if the estimated 50Â million users whose data was taken by Cambridge were taken into account. The FTC declined to comment. Facebook has denied violating the consent decree. âWe reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree,â Facebook said in a statement to The Washington Post late Saturday. âWe respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.â David Vladeck, a former director of the FTCâs Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that because the practice of collecting friend data went well beyond Cambridge, âthat in itself may be a serious problem, especially given the language of the consent decrees, which differentiates between users and others.â Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged the FTC on Monday to investigate Facebook. âFTC should immediately investigate and sanction apparent breach by Facebook of its 2011 agreement guaranteeing protection of consumer info â now a hollow promise,â Blumenthal wrote on Twitter. Facebook once appeared to acknowledge that some data collection by developers ran counter to the expectations of Facebook users. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, âWeâve heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.â That admission may indicate that people had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friendsâ data were used by third parties. Facebook âgoes into this endless hairsplitting that people should have known,â said Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group that has brought privacy cases before the FTC. âNo one could have known that their friends were disclosing their personal data on their behalf. Itâs entirely illogical, and it breaks the consent law.â Facebook has the ability to ban, sue, warn or audit developers of apps who break their policies. The social network has occasionally cracked down: In 2014, Facebook blocked two advertising partners, HasOffers and Kontagent, for violating policies on retaining customer data and failing to notify partner companies about their data collection practices. In 2011, Carol Davidsen, director of data integration and media analytics for Obama for America, built a database of every American voter using the same Facebook developer tool used by Cambridge, known as the social graph API. Any time people used Facebookâs log-in button to sign on to the campaignâs website, the Obama data scientists were able to access their profile as well as their friendsâ information. That allowed them to chart the closeness of peopleâs relationships and make estimates about which people would be most likely to influence other people in their network to vote. âWe ingested the entire U.S. social graph,â Davidsen said in an interview. âWe would ask permission to basically scrape your profile, and also scrape your friends, basically anything that was available to scrape. We scraped it all.â FarmVilleâs developer, Zynga, and Tinder did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

By Sara M. Watson Sara M. Watson is a technology critic and an affiliate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. October 12, 2017 Have you taken a close look at your ads lately? Washington and Silicon Valley have been shocked by each new discovery recently of how Russian operatives bought ads on Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media networks during the 2016 campaign. Kremlin-linked troll farms bought cheap advertising with a very wide reach, possibly getting their messages in front of millions of American voters. Such ads are our clearest example yet of the ways that personalization and microtargeting â basics in the business of data on the Internet â can be weaponized. And itâs not just ads we need to worry about â itâs all forms of personalization. In a world where more and more interfaces are personalized, we need better means to exert our preferences and protect against misuse. Russian interference using standard business practices such as buying ads on Facebook puts into stark relief the lack of oversight of the potential misuses and abuses of technologies that filter our daily lives. Ads are the best signal we have to show us how our personal data is being used. Weâve begun to see examples of how targeted advertising online has moved from the commercial into the political sphere. ProPublica has reported that Facebook made it possible for advertisers to target racial proxies buying ads for categories like âethnic affinity groupsâ and âjew haters.â An Australian Facebook ad team presented leaked research suggesting how emotionally unstable teens might be targeted. The Trump campaign deployed âSuper Predatorâ dark posts targeting black voters to suppress turnout just before the election. But Russiaâs digital tactics demonstrate just how far exploitative microtargeting can go. Today there is no neutral interface, no unfiltered feed. From music recommendations to algorithmically generated news feeds, even search results and front pages of news sources, our digital lives are tailored to match our unique behavioral patterns. We canât toggle between a neutral experience and a personalized one. Most of what feeds into microtargeting is based on assumptions â algorithms observe past behavior, process it through a prioritization system and spit back out more of what you will like, or what will get you to spend more of your money or time. At best, these systems anticipate our needs and interests and tailor our experience accordingly. At worst, though, they are deployed to take advantage of us. Itâs hard to find the fuzzy line between appropriate uses and misuses of the technology. Whatâs the difference between a retargeted ad selling shoes vs. one discussing protection of the Second Amendment? This is about more than just annoying ads. Itâs about our agency to understand and control the interfaces with which we live every day. Facebook has responded with an action plan to address election integrity issues. Ads targeted to various users will be available on one page for users to compare to what others are seeing. Facebook will also finally make political advertising disclosures more transparent, as regulation of TV and other media already requires. But these efforts do not address the wider influence of microtargeting and personalization on this and other platforms. Interfaces dealing in user data need to be held accountable to their users. Beyond the ones Facebook has proposed, there are a number of solutions that platforms and regulators can pursue. First, interfaces need to develop means of expressing the degree to which an experience is personalized to users. This allows platforms to explain the inputs that go into the personalized feed or recommendation, and also gives users a means of interacting with and responding to those inputs or algorithm weights. Imagine telling the Facebook feed that for the next week you want to see more news articles and fewer cat videos. Platforms can test their assumptions against us and provide even better personalized experiences. We need that level of granular control over the personalized interfaces to gain more control and agency over our experiences. Second, we need to apply some of the lessons from traditional advertising to the Wild West that is online advertising. We need to regulate appropriate and inappropriate uses of microtargeting, with consumer protection principles in mind. Whether updating Federal Election Commission regulations for political advertising standards, or looking to industry self-regulation as was once done for subliminal advertising, further oversight over digital targeting is needed. Finally, we need to develop more data and better literacy of these practices to develop normative stances on what are acceptable and appropriate forms of targeting. The Russian-bought ads have struck a nerve, but we need more examples of microtargeting out in the open to clearly articulate our appetite for personalized experiences. Facebook allows users to manage the categories its algorithms have determined you might be interested in, often based on apps youâve installed or pages youâve liked or interacted with. We can also ask, âWhy Am I Seeing This Ad?â about a particular ad by clicking on the ââ¦â in the top right corner of a post or ad. You might be included on brandsâ customer list or could be targeted in a broad category such as âwomen ages 18 to 34 who live in the United States.â You can also use the same feature to remove certain people or publications from your feed. For now, though, these opportunities to provide input happen through micro-interactions or are buried inÂ Ad Preferences settings. These approaches wonât solve all problems. We may remove protected categories from ad-targeting drop-down menus, but advanced data services such as Cambridge Analytica will be able to microtarget based on proprietary email lists. Platforms maintain that giving users more control results in information overload and management fatigue, but the option for further insight and control needs to exist for at least the savviest users. For the rest of us, we need mechanisms for oversight to identify instances of misuse and abuse to protect against further exploitation and manipulation. Subliminal advertising has been regulated away â for good reason. This is the modern equivalent in our digital lives. Itâs time we take personalization personally."}
{"originalUrl":"http://www.businessinsider.de/facebook-suspends-cambridge-analytica-strategic-communication-laboratories-2018-3","title":"Facebook suspends data-analysis firm Cambridge Analytica from platform - Business Insider","text":"Facebook announced on Friday that Cambridge Analytica, the data-analysis firm that played an important role in Donald Trump's online strategy during the 2016 US election, has been suspended from the social-media platform for mishandling user data. Grewal noted that another company, Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), was also suspended. By booting the companies from its platform \"pending further information,\" Facebook will no longer allow them to buy ads or manage their pages. \"Protecting people's information is at the heart of what we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook,\"Grewel said, noting that Facebook had received recent reports of certain rules violations. According to Grewal's statement, a University of Cambridge professor who had developed a personality prediction app for Facebook users called \"thisisyourdigitallife\" improperly passed user information to other parties, including Cambridge Analytica and SCL in 2015. Facebook allows some apps to get access to a user's profile and important data that identifies the user's preferences and interests. Facebook said the professor, Cambridge Analytica, and the other parties involved agreed to destroy all the data at the time. But, Grewel said on Friday, \"several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. Such information, if misused, can potentially help bad actors target Facebook users with ads and other information. This was apparently the case during the 2016 US presidential election. Trump's campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June that year to help target ads using voter data gathered from millions of adults in the US. Several news outlets reported in 2016 that the Trump campaign paid Cambridge Analytica $5 million for its services in September alone that year, a significant increase from the $250,000 it paid one month earlier. The matter of those emails and an FBI investigation surrounding Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state had hamstrung the Clinton campaign, and was seen as one part of a broader effort by Russian operatives to influence the US election. It also raised questions about whether Trump associates had cooperated with Russia's election-meddling activity, because Russian operatives capitalized on detailed user data to deliver targeted ads and content on Facebook and other social-media platforms. Worries about whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin arose in part because the content touted by Russian state actors was highly specific, and targeted to competitive US voter precincts — details that some experts have said would not have been familiar to a foreign entity. The Trump campaign has sought to distance itself from Cambridge Analytica, and has denied any wrongdoing. In an email to Business Insider, a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson said the company \"fully complies with Facebook's terms of service\" and said it is working with Facebook to resolve the matter. Read Cambridge Analytica's full statement below: \"Cambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook's terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. Cambridge Analytica's Commercial and Political divisions use social media platforms for outward marketing, delivering data-led and creative content to targeted audiences. They do not use or hold data from Facebook profiles. In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States. This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR was also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. GSR obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR. We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted. No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign. Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations.\" We are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why. We Maintain Strict Standards and Policies Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc. Like all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\" Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it. Although Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data. Breaking the Rules Leads to Suspension Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior. How Things Have Changed We are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process, which requires developers to justify the data they're looking to collect and how they're going to use it - before they're allowed to even ask people for it. In 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time. On an ongoing basis, we also do a variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our policies and a positive experience for users. These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps. We enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our platform, to pursuing litigation.\""}

Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. Cambridge Analytica, a firm that specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages, ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States. The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, âthisisyourdigitallife,â offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as âa research app used by psychologists.â The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had likedÂ and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015. The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted. âWe are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,â the company said. âIf true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.â Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment. The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. âCambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright,Â research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the companyâs systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election. The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers. Facebook said this was standard practice for large political and corporate spenders.

Photo by Geralt on Pixabay Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been invited to the Parliament to explain reports that improperly collected data was used to manipulate elections. Misuse of Facebook data Â London-based company Cambridge Analytica is accused of having used the Facebook data of millions of voters without their permission to target them through personalised political advertisements during the US elections. This has prompted Parliament President Antonio Tajani to invite the Facebook CEO to the Parliament. Â \"I am deeply concerned by allegations that Cambridge Analytica harvested information from Facebook accounts without user consent, exposing key ethical issues surrounding the accountability and responsibility of powerful digital platforms,â said Tajani. âThis incident is more than a breach of data, it's a breach of trust that can threaten the very functioning of democracy.â Â âI have invited Mark Zuckerberg to the European Parliament to provide explanations, as we have a duty to safeguard citizens' rights and ensure that they are informed, especially with regards to sensitive issues like data protection.\" Â What Parliament can do Â On Wednesday 17 April, MEPs will discuss whether the European laws are an effective shield against personal data abuse and election manipulation following revelations about abuse of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica. Â In addition to holding a debate, other options are also open to Parliament, should MEPs decide to do so.Â MEPs could adopt a resolution calling on the European Commission to propose measures to tackle the misuse. Parliament may also opt to set up a temporary committee to look into the allegations and possible measures. Â What Parliament has done to protect privacy Â Parliament has always insisted on the need to reconcile security with the need to safeguard privacy and personal data. It has adopted resolutions addressing the use of passenger name record (PNR) data for the prevention and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime, data mining and the need to protect private information in a digitised world. The revelations about the misuse of FacebookÂ´s data emerged as the EU prepares for the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation in May.Â It sets new rules for companies operating in the EU and gives people more control over their private information. The legislation includes the right to know when personal data has been hacked and the right to object to profiling. Â The Parliament also wants to step up protection for people using electronic communications by reforming the e-Privacy directive (2002). The proposal seeks to ensure high standards of privacy, confidentiality and security in electronic communications tools such as Messenger, WhatsApp and Skype. Â MEPs suggest setting stricter limits on data processing, ensuring that data can only be used for the purpose for which the user has given consent and guaranteeing that meta-data - information about numbers called, websites visited, and geographical location - is treated as confidential and cannot be passed on to third parties."}

Choosing to delete your Facebook account is a little too drastic for most users, so Mozilla came up with an alternative. If you use the Firefox browser, it's now easy to stop Facebook tracking you around the web. Announced on The Mozilla Blog today, a new add-on for the Firefox browser has been launched called Facebook Container. When installed, it stops Facebook from tracking you around the web, but importantly, allows Facebook to function as normal when you're actually using the social network. Mozilla achieved this by isolating your Facebook identity and placing it in a separate container to the rest of your browsing experience. By doing so, it's much harder for Facebook to track any visits to other websites through third-party cookies. As Nick Nguyen, VP of Firefox Product explains, the aim here was to offer, \"A solution that doesn't tell users to simply stop using a service that they get value from. Instead, it gives users tools that help them protect themselves from the unexpected side effects of their usage.\" Related If you are worried about the data being collected about you, but don't want to stop using the social network, Facebook Container is a great solution for protecting yourself. It's also a good reason to install and start using the Firefox browser if you haven't already. Once installed, you'll know the add-on is working by the blue Facebook and lock symbol that appears in the address bar when visiting Facebook, just like in the image above.

Just how safe are you online? Many people are asking that question this week after Facebook and Orbitz admitted to being unable to protect consumers' private data. Experts say these instances are not the first and certainly won't be the last. At Culver-Stockton College, sophomore Samantha Schuler limits what she puts online and sticks to big companies like Amazon that she feels are more secure when making purchases. \"I'll avoid any sites I see on ads, so anything that isn't like a big name I just won't really go to,\" Schuler said. \"If I do, I don't shop at all.\" Freshman Kyle Starnge frequently sees his friends on Facebook sharing surveys used by third party companies to collect consumer data. He believes the public needs to be more educated on cyber security. \"When you go through your feed and stuff you see people sharing links to things like that, quizzes about personality, who you're going to marry, and your celebrity look-alike,\" said Starnge. Professor of Cyber Security Dr. Joseph Liesen said many people are now numb to these breaches and should assume all their information is going to breached eventually. \"The only things that are sure in this life are death, taxes, and data breaches. We have to ensure we take responsibility, and sometimes that's inconvenient,\" Liesen said. \"Sometimes that's painful. There are some pain points associated with multi-factor authentification, for example.\" Liesen also mentioned the public should not worry about credit cards being breached and should be more concerned with sites like Equifax. \"Those breaches are forever. They have all of your personal information, all of your credit history. Those are the ones you should really be worried about,\" Liesen said. \"I think a credit monitoring system, an identify theft system, make a lot of sense.\" Here are some cyber security tips: -Make sure your devices are completely patched with the latest version. -Never use a debit card on the internet, because your liability is typically $1500. A credit card's liability is only $50 or less. -Use on-shore, reputable sites, with :https links-Use passwords with 12 characters, which take centuries to crack. 10 characters or less can be hacked in a short amount of time. -Anti-malware should be run at least once a week"}

In this role he leads projects that focus on the practical applications of ICTs in development Mar 15 The Jamaican cook shop: on the frontlines of the new Data Protection Act David Munroe of Family Works Restaurant on Old Hope RoadÂ â¦ but how will the Data Protection Act work for him and other small and family-owned businesses inÂ Jamaica? What does the humble Jamaican cook shop and the pursuit of being Jamaicaâs own Mark Zuckerberg have in common? Actually, quite a lot, thanks to provisions under the Data Protection Act, which SlashRoots and the Make.Better Software Developers Community worry could have an outsized impact on Jamaican business and innovation. We strongly believe in every Jamaicanâs right to privacy and commend the Government for trying to ensure that legislature to guide what this right should look like, keeps pace with todayâs technology. The hard part is finding a middle ground that does not stifle innovation or place unreasonable regulation on individuals and businesses across Jamaica (or âdata controllersâ as they are called in the bill). What do I mean? With the digital tools available today, it has never been easier to setup a Facebook page, launch a website, or create an app to test a business idea with prospective customers. But under the proposed Data Protection Bill, if you want to collect their information, you would first need to register as a data controller; appoint a âdata protection officerâ; pay a fee; and within 11 months, submit an audit of your activities. Sounds daunting? Well, even if you arenât in tech, you could also be impacted. In making our submission to Parliament yesterday, March 13th 2018, we spoke about how everyday people and businesses, like the Jamaican cookshop, will be impacted. Our friendly meal providerâââwho we imagine provides an invaluable community service serving great fried chicken with curry gravyâââmust now also get his head around the fact that heâs a data controller since he does in fact handle customer data in the eyes of the proposed law. This could be names, mobile numbers, delivery addresses, or balances for customers who âtrus a foodâ. Video of SlashRootsâ submission to Parliament. Curryman and other small to medium-sized business owners may find these new requirements challenging and we worry that burden of compliance may not match the risks for data misuse or their capacities. In the coming months the public will become more and more aware of the Act. FYI: the next meeting of the Joint Select Committee will be at 10am on Tuesday, March 27. The Data Protection Act is probably the most far reaching legislation to be discussed in recent time, even more so than the controversial NIDS Bill. It is vital that the act provide an enabling, rather than a restrictive framework, for data use. We believe the members of the Committee want a healthy debate on the bill and broad engagement with the public. We invite you to click here and read our submission to Parliament. If you run a cook shop or any business at least, for your own benefit, please at least read our following key recommendations: A Tiered Data Controller SystemâââA tiered system be established that exempts or reduces the obligations of organizations as âdata controllersâ based upon their size, risks of data misuse, or age. Broaden The Definition Of ConsentâââThe definition of consent be broadened to include âinformed consentâ. And that definition should require it to be specific, informed, unambiguous and active. Annual Report On ExemptionsâââThe Data Commissioner should publish an annual report on the number of data protection exception requests and restrictions that have been granted. Independent Oversight For ExemptionsâââAn Independent Oversight Mechanism for Tax and National Security exemptions under the bill. This oversight mechanism should include representation of civil society. The requests should be reviewed at regular intervals. A Digital Audit Trail for all recordsâââEven in cases where a data subjectâs record or a digital service receives an exemption, all accesses to data record must still be recorded and auditable.

{"originalUrl":"https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/dont-deletefacebook-thats-not-good-enough.html","title":"Donât #DeleteFacebook. Thatâs not good enough.","text":"It insults those who donât have the privilege of leaving. And it suggests Facebook has failed consumersâwhen the company has really failed society. People are mad at Facebook, and they should be. The company allowed thousands of app developers to extract their data through time-sucking games and pointless online quizzes. And now, thanks to a whistleblower and two stunning reports in the Observer and the New York Times, we know that one of those developers siphoned data on more than 50 million Facebook users and shared them with the Trump campaignâs voter targeting firm, Cambridge Analyticaâa company that has bragged it has psychological profiles on 230 million American voters, which it uses to target people online with emotionally precise digital messaging to influence elections. This was the trade-off for logging in to see baby photos? Whether Cambridge Analyticaâs claims are inflated (only about 139 million people voted in the 2016 election, after all) is fair to debate, but the heart of the controversy is harder to dismiss: It now feels time to reconsider Facebookâs bargain. We gave the company the trust it asked for, along with our photos and thoughts and likes and shares. We all knew of course, that this information helped Facebook sell us to advertisers; fewer were probably aware that until a few years ago, app developers also had access to our data, even if it was there in the terms of service. Many certainly didnât think that those app developers could break those terms and sell that data to whomever they wanted, including political operatives. This may not technically be a âbreachâ of Facebookâs platform, as the company has stressed. But it is a breach of trust. Hence: #DeleteFacebook. The Twitter hashtag emerged in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations, and began to feel like a movement Tuesday night when WhatsApp co-founder Brian Actonâa man whose company was sold to Facebook for $16 billionâtweeted that âIt is time.â The #DeleteFacebook instinct is understandable: Just be done with it. Put your phone to your ear and call people. Use Twitter or Instagramâthe latter of which is owned by Facebook, but hey, at the least itâs mostly made up of sun-dappled vacation photos. Write a letter! Talk to neighbors! Whatever you do to fill that void of connection, just walk away from Facebook. If youâre angry about what Facebook is doing, the logic goes, you should take your business elsewhere. I understand this reaction, but itâs also an unfair one: Deleting Facebook is a privilege. The company has become so good at the many things it does that for lots of people, leaving the service would be a self-harming act. And they deserve better from it, too. Which is why the initial answer to Facebookâs failings shouldnât be to flee Facebook. We need to demand a better Facebook. I say all this as someone who basically did walk away from Facebook a few years ago. I still have an account, but I tend to just log on out of curiosity, to report a story, or to write the occasional life update. I donât have the app on my phone, and I probably log in once a week. But I could afford to leave Facebookâand I did pay a cost for it. Iâve lost touch with friends. I donât go out much anymore and donât know when cool things I might like to go to are happening. Iâm pretty much not a part of any scene anymore. I donât know when old friends are in town Iâd love to see. Back when I promoted art openings and booked music shows, I always had to make a Facebook event; if I wanted to do so again, Iâd still have to go through Facebook. Leaving Facebook was a retreat. But not everyone has the luxury of making one. For lots of people, leaving Facebook would be a self-harming act. And they deserve better from it,too. Unlike broadcast television and radio, which are also free for the price of having to endure ads, on Facebook you canât change the channel. If you leave Facebookâwhich is where your friends, scene, and community already isâyouâre alone, because for many people, Facebook is becoming the internet and the internet is becoming Facebook. Your business could have trouble reaching customers; your family might not gather on another social network; no one posts any events anywhere else. All of which means that leaving Facebook simply doesnât make sense for many people. Itâs a network effect, a kind of natural monopoly; migrating to another social network would only work if enough people migrate there, too. In other words, if you want to be a part of any social life or local political conversations or want to promote your work, that simply means being on Facebook. Even when I left Facebook personally, I didnât professionally. Thatâs because media outlets rely on Facebook, too. A huge chunk of the readers of my articles find them through Facebookâand if they like them, they share them on Facebook, so others can read them. But my work depended on Facebook before I was a journalist, too. When I was an activist working to defend online privacy and protect people from digital surveillance at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, we would post our blog posts and events â¦ yep, on Facebook. Itâs one of the main ways we got the word out. The same was true at previous jobs. Every campaign or issue I was organizing around needed to have a presence on Facebook. Before Facebook, activists sent a lot of emails and made a lot of phone calls. It worked, but as soon as everyone started using Facebook, we had to be there too. Otherwise we risked invisibility. Likewise, if you have a small business, sometimes a Facebook page is your online presence. If youâre not operating in the service industry or with a storefront, Yelp might not make sense. Facebook, for all its problems, has become a necessary part of life for people, one that they canât afford to shed, personally or professionally. And in countries with lower internet adoption, Facebook is often peopleâs foray onto the whole internet. Facebookâs Free Basics program is operating in 63 countries and municipalities across Africa, Asia, and Latin Americaâand with that, people get free access to Facebook and a small handful of websites that partner with Facebook, though they canât access other sites or email. For those users, Facebook is, in a sense, the whole internet. So sure, delete Facebook if you can. The company may not deserve your trust or your business, and youâll have more free time to do other, better things. But if you canât quit, thatâs OK, too. Thatâs why #DeleteFacebook is the wrong message: It frames this as an issue of individual consumer choice. But itâs really a problem in search of a solution either from Facebook itselfâchanging its service so that its users really can feel safeâor from the government, which may need to step in and blow the whistle on Facebookâs entire business model. If you think Facebook is worth deleting over its issues, then call your elected official to regulate the company, as well as other companies, like Google, that profit from harvesting our personal details to sell ads tailored to us across the internet. Because itâs becoming clearer that we canât trust these companies to regulate themselves, and these conversations about user privacy, security, and well-being are incredibly important for those who canât afford to not be on Facebook. Thereâs no comprehensive federal online privacy law in the U.S. Meanwhile, these companies have become some of the most powerful and wealthy entities in the world in large part thanks to having few checks on their data collection. The more we learn about that corporate surveillance, the less simple it is to dismiss it. It was only a few months ago that journalists learned that Facebook let advertisers target people based on hateful keywords, like âJew hatersâ and âHow to burn Jews.â And Facebook knew that Cambridge Analytica had wrongfully obtained tens of millions of their usersâ data without saying a word publiclyâand even then, it took two years and teams of journalists to write major stories about how bad the whole situation was to get Facebook to fess up. So Iâm with you, Facebook deleters, but only to a point. Because as constituents of Facebook, we also need to advocate for a safer platform for anyone whoâs unable to hop off."}

'She was prepared to discuss intimate details relating to Mr Trump,' Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti said Monday during an appearance on Today.Â 'She can describe his genitalia. She can describe various conversations that they had that leave no doubt as to whether this woman is telling the truth.' He then added: 'And if she's not telling the truth, let the president take to the podium and call her a liar. Let the president come forward and say it never happened.' President Trump has not directly responded to the interview, but on Monday morning he did tweet: 'So much Fake News. Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. But through it all, our country is doing great!'Â Scroll down for videosÂ Digging deep:Â Michael Avenatti (above), the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, appeared on the morning shows Monday after his client's interview on 60 Minutes Tweet it\"Â 'So much Fake News. Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. But through it all, our country is doing great!' tweeted President Trump on Monday (above) Avenetti alsoÂ stopped by Good Morning America on Monday to discuss his clients interview on 60 Minutes and respond to criticism about the lack of evidence she presented on the program. 'We're in the very early stages of this case, and we're not gonna play all of our cards at this juncture. No good attorney would,' said Avenatti. 'There's gonna be a lot of evidence Â that will come to light in the coming weeks and months and we're confident that when all of the facts are laid bare for the American people they're gonna learn exactly what happened here.' This includes the identify of the individual who allegedly threatened Daniels back in 2011 and how she received her reported $130,000 payout after signing a non-disclosure agreement two weeks before the election.Â Â Share this article Avenatti said that while President Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen may have cut the check for $130,000, he is not the person who ultimately covered that sizable payout.Â 'I think when all is said and done, it will be clear that it did not come from [Cohen] or there was a promise of reimbursement,' stated Avenatti.Â 'Regardless, Mr Cohen and the president have a significant problem related to this $130,000 and the agreement.' He addressed the individual who threatened his client seven years ago as well, soon after she detailed her alleged one-night stand with President Trump in an interview.Â 'It had to have come from someone associated with Mr. Trump,' explained Avenatti.Â 'It didn't come from the magazine. That makes no sense. It was certainly not my client. There's only one other place that could have come from. And that threat was terrifying to my client.' When asked if his client told anyone or went to the police after that threat, Avenatti responded: 'She was scared. No.' It was then pointed out that this might make the story difficult to stand up, which Avenatti denied, saying: 'I don't think so. I think we're going to get to the bottom of this. The threat, the agreement, the bottom of the $130,000 payment.' Daniels' lawyer also said at one point that President trump had never denied the affair, a claim which was met with immediate push back as it was pointed out there have been many denials.Â 'Well actually, the president has never denied it. He's been silent. He can tweet on every other subject known the mankind. For some reason, he can't deny the affair,' said Avenatti.Â 'He can't come out and deny the existence of the agreement and his knowledge of it. And can't deny the $130,000 payment. Why is that?' Avenatti also addressed whether or not he was concerned about his client possibly losing everything, as she is now facing a $20 million lawsuit for speaking out.Â 'Our position is that the NDA was never executed and it was never valid for a host of reasons and we're confident that a court is going to find that, he stated. 'We have a litany of more evidence in this case. And it's going to be disclosed. And it's going to be laid bare for the American public.' He then confirmed that this included direct evidence to prove an affair occurred between his client and President Trump.Â Avenatti ended things be responding to a question about why he chose to hold back during his client's big moment on Sunday night. 'I don't think that was our biggest possible platform and we're gonna be smart and we want to be deliberate,' he explained.Â Big moment:Â Among the new claims were that she spanked the president with a magazine and a man threatened her back in 2011 after she spoke of the alleged affair Troubles: Melania Trump (above with President Trump on Friday) is spending the week in Palm Beach while he husband returned to DC on Sunday Avenatti was criticized for his decision to tease and then withhold information on Morning Joe as well, with the decision leaving host Joe Scarborough in disbelief.Â 'You showed a CD and teased you had information on there. What's the triggering point for you to go ahead and show the world what's on the CD? What has to happen first?' asked Scarborough at one point.Â 'Because you said that they had to threaten you. They've already threatened you.'Â The talk later shifted to the individual who allegedly threatened Daniels in 2011, with Scarborough pointing out that no description of the man was given on the program. Avenatti revealed that Daniels could describe the man and thought he was very good looking after she encountered him in 2011 for the first time. He did not go into any further detail.Â Daniels said she was threatened by that man to keep silent about her alleged sexual encounter on Sunday. The porn star, 39, claimed that she was threatened by an unidentified man in Las Vegas to keep quiet about her alleged relationship with Trump, an incident that she said happened while she was with her young daughter.Â Daniels spoke about her alleged one-night stand with President Trump for the first time on TV Sunday, revealing few new details about the 2006 tryst Â (Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen above) She said in the interview that she had one encounter of consensual sex with the future president. She did not allege however that she was coerced into the encounter with the real estate scion, saying, 'This is not a Me too. I was not a victim.' The adult film actress provided little new evidence of her alleged 2006 affair with Trump but said she faced intimidation tactics aimed at ensuring her silence in 2011. Daniels said that in the incident, in a parking lot, the man told her: 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.' She claimed he then looked at her daughter and added: 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' Daniels received a $130,000 payment days before the 2016 presidential election for her silence and has sought to invalidate that agreement in recent weeks. The White House did not immediately comment on the interview, though Trump, has denied the allegations mutliple times in the past through spokespeople and lawyers includingÂ Cohen, who claims that he paid the $130,000 out of his pocket. He has also stated that neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Daniels and he was not reimbursed for the payment. Avenatti provided evidence to 60 Minutes however that showed documents with Cohen using his Trump Organization email address in setting up the paymen. There was also evidence that the nondisclosure agreement was sent by FedEx to Cohen at his Trump Organization office in Trump Tower. In the interview, Daniels described a sexual encounter with Trump that began with him talking about himself and showing her an issue of a magazine with his picture on the cover.Â She then asked: 'Does this normally work for you?' That threw Trump off guard she claimed, going on to explain: 'And I was like, \"Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it.\"' Daniels then ordered Trump to drop his pants and 'gave him a couple swats' in playful manner she said to Cooper. She said they talked some more after that and that she became more comfortable when he stopped speaking about himself. 'He was like, \"Wow, you - you are special. You remind me of my daughter.\" You know - he was like, \"You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you,\"' said Daniels. Similar tales: Daniels interview came just a few days after former Playmate Karen McDougal (above with Trump in 2006) made similar claims The pair had dinner in Trump's room she said and then had sex.Â He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said. Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on The Apprentice, and she likened it to a 'business opportunity.'Â After the alleged tryst she said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and would claim that he had an update for her about the Apprentice.Â She said she felt that he was holding out the opportunity to keep her coming back. 'Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?' said Daniels. In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to. Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again. When asked why she was deciding to speak now, Daniels said: 'Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself.' She said she was not all that bothered by what other people thought of her, but had a big issuer with being portrayed as someone who did not tell the truth. 'I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, \"Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this,\"' said Daniels. 'Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done?' Cooper noted during the interview that Melania Trump had given birth just a few months before the alleged encounter between the two.Â 'Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?' asked Cooper.Â 'I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, \"Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff,'' said Daniels.Â Just a few days prior, former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt. McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election. The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media. Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice. Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up. A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office.Â THE TRANSCRIPT: STORMY DANIELS SPILLS ALL ABOUT HER ALLEGED AFFAIR WITH DONALD TRUMP ON 60 MINUTES Stormy Daniels (pictured) told all about her alleged affair with Donald Trump Anderson Cooper: For sitting here talking to me today you could be fined a million dollars I mean aren't you taking a big risk? Stormy Daniels: I am. Anderson Cooper: I guess I'm not 100% sure on why you're doing this. Stormy Daniels: Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself Anderson Cooper: Is part of talking w-- wanting to set the record straight? Stormy Daniels: 100%. Anderson Cooper: Why does the record need to be set straight? Stormy Daniels: Because people are just saying whatever they wanted to say about me, I was perfectly fine saying nothing at all, but I'm not okay with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, \"Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this. Yes, I'm getting more job offers now, but tell me one person who would turn down a job offer making more than they've been making, doing the same thing that they've always done? Anderson Cooper: A lotta people are using you for a lotta different agendas. Stormy Daniels: They're trying to. Like, oh, you know, Stormy Daniels comes out #MeToo. This is not a 'Me Too.' I was not a victim. I've never said I was a victim. I think trying to use me to-- to further someone else's agenda, does horrible damage to people who are true victims. Stormy Daniels' real name is Stephanie Clifford. She's 39 years old, from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and has been acting in, directing, and writing adult films for nearly 20 years. She was one of the most popular actresses in the adult industry when she was introduced to Mr. Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in July, 2006. She says he invited her to dinner, and she met him at his hotel suite. Anderson Cooper: How was the conversation? Stormy Daniels: Ummm (LAUGH) it started off-- all about him just talking about himself. And he's like-- \"Have you seen my new magazine? Anderson Cooper: He was showing you his own picture on the cover of a magazine. Stormy Daniels: Right, right. And so I was like, \"Does this-- does this normally work for you?\" And he looked very taken-- taken back, like, he didn't really understand what I was saying. Like, I was-- does, just, you know, talking about yourself normally work?\" And I was like, \"Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it.\" (LAUGH) And I'll never forget the look on his face. He was like-- Anderson Cooper: What-- what was his look? Stormy Daniels: Just, I don't think anyone's ever spoken to him like that, especially, you know, a young woman who looked like me. And I said, you know, \"Give me that,\" and I just remember him going, \"You wouldn't.\" \"Hand it over.\" And-- so he did, and I was like, turn around, drop 'em.\" Stormy Daniels, an adult film star and director whose real name is Stephanie Clifford is interviewed by Anderson Cooper of CBS News' 60 Minutes program Anderson Cooper: You-- you told Donald Trump to turn around and take off his pants. Stormy Daniels: Yes. Anderson Cooper: And did he? Stormy Daniels: Yes. So he turned around and pulled his pants down a little -- you know had underwear on and stuff and I just gave him a couple swats. Anderson Cooper: This was done in a joking manner. Stormy Daniels: Yes. and-- from that moment on, he was a completely different person. Anderson Cooper: How so? Stormy Daniels: He quit talking about himself and he asked me things and I asked him things and it just became like more appropriate. Anderson Cooper: It became more comfortable. Stormy Daniels: Yeah. He was like, \"Wow, you-- you are special. You remind me of my daughter.\" You know-- he was like, \"You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you.\" Anderson Cooper: At this point was he doing The Apprentice? Stormy Daniels: Yes. And he goes, \"Got an idea, honeybunch. Would you ever consider going on and-- and being a contestant?\" And I laughed and-- and said, \"NBC's never gonna let, you know, an adult film star be on.\" It's, you know, he goes, \"No, no,\" he goes, \"That's why I want you. You're gonna shock a lotta people, you're smart and they won't know what to expect\" Anderson Cooper: Did you think he was serious, or did you think he was kind of dangling to get you to wanna be involved him? Stormy Daniels: Both. Anderson Cooper: Melania Trump had recently given birth to-- to a son, just a few months before. Did that-- did he mention his wife or child at all in this? Stormy Daniels: I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, \"Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even we have separate rooms and stuff.\" Anderson Cooper: Did you two go out for dinner that night? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: You had dinner in the room? Stormy Daniels: Yes. Anderson Cooper: What happened next? Stormy Daniels: I asked him if I could use his restroom and he said, \"Yes, you know, it's through those-- through the bedroom, you'll see it.\" So I-- I excused myself and I went to the-- the restroom. You know, I was in there for a little bit and came out and he was sitting, you know, on the edge of the bed when I walked out, perched. Anderson Cooper: And when you saw that, what went through your mind? Stormy Daniels: I realized exactly what I'd gotten myself into. And I was like, \"Ugh, here we go.\" (LAUGH) And I just felt like maybe-- (LAUGH) it was sort of-- I had it coming for making a bad decision for going to someone's room alone and I just heard the voice in my head, \"well, you put yourself in a bad situation and bad things happen, so you deserve this.\" Anderson Cooper: And you had sex with him. Stormy Daniels: Yes. Anderson Cooper: You were 27, he was 60. Were you physically attracted to him? Stormy Daniels: No. Stormy Daniels says she had unprotected sex with Donald Trump and spanked him with a magazine that had his face on the cover, even though she wasn't physically attracted to him Anderson Cooper: Not at all? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: Did you want to have sex with him? Stormy Daniels: No. But I didn't-- I didn't say no. I'm not a victim, I'm not-- Anderson Cooper: It was entirely consensual. Stormy Daniels: Oh, yes, yes. Anderson Cooper: You work in an industry where condom use is-- is an issue. Did-- did he use a condom? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: Did you ask him to? Stormy Daniels: No. I honestly didn't say anything. Anderson Cooper: After you had sex, what happened? Stormy Daniels: He said that it was great, he had-- a great evening, and it was nothing like he expected, that I really surprised him, that a lotta people must underestimate me-- that he hoped that I would be willing to see him again and that we would discuss the things we had talked about earlier in the evening. Anderson Cooper: Being on The Apprentice. Stormy Daniels: Right. Daniels says she and Mr. Trump stayed in touch. She says he invited her to a Trump Vodka launch party in California, as well as to his office in Trump Tower in New York. Anderson Cooper: So he definitely wanted to continue to see you. Stormy Daniels: Oh, for sure. Yes. Stormy Daniels: And this was not a secret. He never asked me not to tell anyone he called several times when I was in front of many people and I would be like, \"Oh my God, he's calling.\" They were like, \"Shut up, the Donald?\" And I'd put him on speakerphone, and he wanted to know what I was up to and \"When can we get together again? I just wanted to give you a quick update, we had a meeting, it went great. There's-- it's gonna be spectacular, they're totally into the idea,\" and I was like mhmm that part I never believed. Anderson Cooper: Did you still get the sense that he was kind of dangling it in front of you-- Stormy Daniels: Oh, for sure, oh yeah. Anderson Cooper: To keep you interested, to keep you coming back. Stormy Daniels: Of course, of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know? Anderson Cooper: Did you view it as this is a potential opportunity. \"I'm gonna see where it goes?\" Stormy Daniels: I thought of it as a business deal. In July 2007 -- a year after they met -- Daniels says Mr. Trump asked to meet with her privately at his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles to discuss a development regarding her possible appearance on Celebrity Apprentice. Stormy Daniels: I remember arriving, and he was watching Shark Week. He made me sit and watch an entire documentary about shark attacks. Anderson Cooper: It wasn't at that point a business meeting, it was just watching Shark Week. Stormy Daniels: Yeah. Anderson Cooper: Did you have sex with him again? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: Did he want to? Stormy Daniels: Yes. Anderson Cooper: How do you know he wanted to? Stormy Daniels: Because he came and sat next to me and, you know, touched my hair, and put his hand on my leg, and r-- referenced back to how great it was the last time. Anderson Cooper: How did you get out of it? Stormy Daniels: Well, I'd been there for, like, four hours. And so I then was like, \"Well, before, you know, can we talk about what's the development?\" And he was like, \"I'm almost there. I'll have an answer for you next week.\" And I was like, \"Okay, cool. Well-- I guess call me next week.\" And I just took my purse and left. According to Daniels, Mr. Trump called her the following month to say he'd not been able to get her a spot on Celebrity Apprentice. She says they never met again and only had sex in that first meeting in 2006. In May 2011, Daniels agreed to tell her story to a sister publication of In Touch magazine for $15,000 dollars. Two former employees of the magazine told us the story never ran because after the magazine called Mr. Trump seeking comment, his attorney Michael Cohen threatened to sue. Daniels says she was never paid, and says a few weeks later, she was threatened by a man who approached her in Las Vegas. Stormy Daniels: I was in a parking lot, going to a fitness class with my infant daughter. T-- taking, you know, the seats facing backwards in the backseat, diaper bag, you know, gettin' all the stuff out. And a guy walked up on me and said to me, \"Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.\" And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, \"That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.\" And then he was gone. Anderson Cooper: You took it as a direct threat? Stormy Daniels: Absolutely. Stormy Daniels: I was rattled. I remember going into the workout class. And my hands are shaking so much, I was afraid I was gonna-- drop her. Anderson Cooper: Did you ever see that person again? Stormy Daniels: No. But I-- if I did, I would know it right away. Anderson Cooper: You'd be able to-- you'd be able to recognize that person? Stormy Daniels: 100%. Even now, all these years later. If he walked in this door right now, I would instantly know. Anderson Cooper: Did you go to the police? Stormy Daniels: No. Anderson Cooper: Why? Stormy Daniels: Because I was scared. When a gossip website reported a few months later that she'd had an affair with Mr. Trump, Stormy Daniels publically denied it. Five years later, Donald Trump won the Republican nomination for president. Stormy Daniels: Suddenly people are reaching out to me again, offering me money. Large amounts of money. Was I tempted? Yes-- I struggle with it. And then I get the call. \"I think I have the best deal for you.\" Anderson Cooper: From your lawyer? Stormy Daniels: Yeah. The deal was an offer not to tell her story. It came from Mr. Trump's attorney Michael Cohen. In return for signing this non-disclosure agreement, Cohen would pay her $130,000 dollars through a Delaware-based limited liability corporation he had established in mid-October 2016 called essential consultants. Daniels says the agreement was appealing because it meant she would receive some money but also not have to worry about the effect the revelation of the affair would have on her child who was now old enough to watch the news. She signed the agreement eleven days before the election. Anderson Cooper: Was it hush money to stay silent? Stormy Daniels: Yes. The story was coming out again. I was concerned for my family and their safety. Anderson Cooper: I think some people watching this are going to doubt that you entered into this negotiation-- because you feared for your safety. They're gonna think y-- that you saw an opportunity. Stormy Daniels: I think the fact that I didn't even negotiate, I just quickly said yes to this v-- very, you know, strict contract. And what most people will agree with me extremely low number. It's all the proof I need. Anderson Cooper: you feel like if you had wanted to go public, you could have gotten paid a lot of money to go public-- Stormy Daniels: Without a doubt. I know for a fact. I believe, without a shadow of a doubt, in my heart, and some people argue that I don't have one of those, but whatever, that I was doing the right thing. I turned down a large payday multiple times because one, I didn't wanna kiss and tell and be labeled all the things that I'm being labeled now. I didn't wanna take away from the legitimate and legal, I'd like to point out, career that I've worked very hard to establish. And most importantly, I did not want my family and my child exposed to all the things that she's being exposed to right now. because everything that I was afraid of coming out has come out anyway, and guess what? I don't have a million dollars. (LAUGH) You didn't even buy me breakfast. Anderson Cooper asked Daniels whether she was 'taking a big risk' speaking to him 15 months after she signed the non-disclosure agreement, in January 2018, the Wall Street Journal published this story, quoting anonymous sources, saying that Mr. Trump's attorney Michael Cohen had paid her for her silence. Daniels says she was not the source of the story. But once it was published, she says she was pressured by her former attorney and former business manager to sign statements that Michael Cohen released publically, denying she'd had an affair with Mr. Trump. Anderson Cooper: So you signed and released-- a statement that said I am not denying this affair because I was paid in hush money I'm denying it because it never happened. That's a lie? Stormy Daniels: Yes. Anderson Cooper: If it was untruthful, why did you sign it? Stormy Daniels: Because they made it sound like I had no choice. Anderson Cooper: I mean, no one was putting a gun to your head? Stormy Daniels: Not physical violence, no. Anderson Cooper: you thought that there would be some sort of legal repercussion if you didn't sign it? Stormy Daniels: Correct. As a matter of fact, the exact sentence used was, \"They can make your life hell in many different ways.\" Anderson Cooper: They beingâ¦ Stormy Daniels: I'm not exactly sure who they were. I believe it to be Michael Cohen. President Trump's attorney Michael Cohen has denied ever threatening Stormy Daniels. The payment Cohen made to her is now the subject of complaints to the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission, alleging that it was an illegal campaign contribution. What makes the dispute between Stormy Daniels and the president more than a high-profile tabloid scandal is that her silence was purchased eleven days before the presidential election, which may run afoul of campaign finance laws. The president's long-time lawyer Michael Cohen says he used $130,000 of his own money to pay Stormy Daniels. Cohen has said the money was not a campaign contribution. But Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission appointed by President George H.W. Bush, told us he doesn't agree. Trevor Potter: The payment of the money just creates an enormous legal mess for I think Trump, for Cohen and anyone else who was involved in this in the campaign. Anderson Cooper: Are you saying that can be seen as a contribution to benefit a campaign? Trevor Potter: I am. it's a $130,000 in-kind contribution by Cohen to the Trump campaign, which is about $126,500 above what he's allowed to give. And if he does this on behalf of his client, the candidate, that is a coordinated, illegal, in-kind contribution by Cohen for the purpose of influencing the election, of benefiting the candidate by keeping this secret. The payment Stormy Daniels received is the subject of complaints by watchdog groups to the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission, which Trevor Potter used to be chairman of. He's now president of the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center, which supports the enforcement of campaign finance laws. Anderson Cooper: If the president paid Michael Cohen back, is that an in-kind campaign contribution that the president should've then reported? Trevor Potter: It is. If he was then reimbursed by the president, that doesn't remove the fact that the initial payment violated Cohen's contribution limits. I guess it mitigates it if he's paid back by the candidate because the candidate could have paid for it without limit. Anderson Cooper: What if the president never reimbursed Michael Cohen? Trevor Potter: Then he is still out on the line, having made a illegal in-kind contribution to the campaign. Anderson Cooper: You're saying this is more serious for Michael Cohen if the president did not pay him back? Trevor Potter: Yes. I think that's correct. We wanted to speak with Mr. Trump's attorney Michael Cohen about this, but he did not respond to our calls and written request for comment. Cohen told The New York Times last month he used his own personal funds to facilitate a payment of $130,000 to Stormy Daniels and said, \"Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump Campaignâ¦ reimbursed me for the payment.\" this past week, Cohen told Vanity Fair magazine, \"What I did defensively for my personal client, and my friend, is what attorneys do for their high-profile clients. I would have done it in 2006. I would have done it in 2011. I truly care about him and the family -- more than just as an employee and an attorney.\" Michael Avenatti: It's laughable. It's ludicrous. It's preposterous. Anderson Cooper: Lawyers don't do that, you're saying. You-- you-- Michael Avenatti: Ever. Michael Avenatti is Stormy Daniels' attorney. He's a Los Angeles trial lawyer who is suing the president in a California court, seeking to have Stormy Daniels' non-disclosure agreement -- or \"NDA\" -- declared invalid, in part because the president never signed it on the lines provided for his alias -- \"D.D.,\" David Dennison. Anderson Cooper: Michael Cohen has said, \"Look, this had nothing to do with the election.\" He would've made this agreement months before. Michael Avenatti: So why didn't he? It just slipped his mind? It's just a coincidence that, in the waning days of the campaign, he thought to himself, \"Oh, you know, I know I've been thinkin' about this for years. Perhaps now is a good time to get that NDA executed with Stormy Daniels.\" Avenatti disputes the notion that Cohen was working in a purely personal capacity when he arranged the hush money for Stormy Daniels. He's found documents that show Michael Cohen used his Trump Organization email address in setting up the payment. He also says the non-disclosure agreement Stormy Daniels signed in 2016, when she was represented by a different lawyer, was FedExed to Cohen at his Trump Organization office in Trump Tower in New York. Michael Avenatti: That is a copy of the Federal Express confirmation The cover letter from Daniels' previous attorney also identifies who he thought Michael Cohen was working for. Michael Avenatti: To Mr. Cohen as executive vice president and special counsel to Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization, again-- listing the 5th Avenue address. this idea that there's a separation now between Mr. Cohen, individually, and the Trump Organization or Mr. Cohen, individually, and Donald Trump, it-- it-- it's nonsense. Anderson Cooper: There are people who argue that this much ado about nothing, that if this was not a story about, an adult film actress and the President of the United States, no one would pay attention. Michael Avenatti: This is about the cover-up. This is about the extent that Mr. Cohen and the president have gone to intimidate this woman, to silence her, to threaten her, and to put her under their thumb. It is thuggish behavior from people in power. And it has no place in American democracy. Avenatti points to this recent court filing in which the president's lawyers claim Daniels is already liable for damages \"in excess of $20 million\" for unspecified violations of her non-disclosure agreement. And in that article in Vanity Fair this past week, Michael Cohen said that when he wins damages from Stormy Daniels, \"I might even take an extended vacation on her dime.\" Anderson Cooper: You're saying they're tryin' to intimidate her. Michael Avenatti: There's no question. You threaten someone-- with a $20 million lawsuit, it's a thuggish tactic. It's no different than what happened in the parking lot in Las Vegas. Anderson Cooper: People make threats in lawsuits all the time. People, you know, say, \"You're gonna have to pay a lot of money when you lose this-- this case.\" Michael Avenatti: People don't threaten people with $20 million lawsuits, that they're gonna take their home and take an extended vacation on the money they receive. People don't conduct themselves like this. They don't. And they shouldn't. Anderson Cooper: Stormy Daniels did sign the agreement. She got $130,000. Isn't she welching on a deal? Michael Avenatti: No, she's not welching on a deal, 'cause there never was a deal. Anderson Cooper: But she still took the money. Michael Avenatti: She took the money. But the fact of the matter is Mr. Trump never signed the agreement. He was obligated to sign the agreement in order for the agreement to spring into effect. That's not true, according to Michael Cohen, who has said only his signature was required. What was also required under the non-disclosure agreement was for Stormy Daniels to turn over all \"video images, still images, email messages, and text messages,\" she had regarding Mr. Trump. Anderson Cooper: Did you do that? Stormy Daniels: I can't answer that right now. Anderson Cooper: You don't want to say one way or the other if you have text messages or other items? Stormy Daniels: My attorney has recommended that I don't discuss those things. Anderson Cooper: You seem to be saying that she has some sort of text message, or video, or-- or photographs. Or you could just be bluffing. Michael Avenatti: You should ask some of the other people in my career when they've bet on me bluffing. Anderson Cooper: In college and law school, you did opposition research for Democratic political operative Rahm Emanuel. Some people looking at that would say you're politically motivated, Michael Avenatti: I haven't done anything in politics in over 20 years. Anderson Cooper: But this is not the usual case you take on. You were a former Democratic operative. And you're talking about deposing the president. That sounds political.\" Trevor Potter, the former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, says the agency's investigations often take a long time and usually result only in monetary penalties. But there is another scenario that could present a problem for the president: special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. In March, the Washington Post reported that the \"special counsel has examined episodes involving Michael Cohen,\" including his efforts to launch a Trump-branded project in Moscow in the fall of 2015 when Mr. Trump was seeking the Republican nomination. Anderson Cooper: is there any way that special counsel Robert Mueller could investigate the Stormy Daniels payment? Trevor Potter: Yeah that's the wildcard here. Anderson Cooper: As a prosecutor, you wanna get leverage over somebody that you could then use to get them to give you other information on which-- Trevor Potter: Correct. Anderson Cooper: --you're really interested in? Trevor Potter: Correct. That's what special counsel Mueller appears to be doing with Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, who faces multiple charges including tax and bank fraud. Anderson Cooper: Paul Manafort has been charged with crimes that don't have anything to do with Russia in some cases. Trevor Potter: Well, and that certainly preceded the campaign. And so-- clearly, the Justice Department, the deputy attorney general who is ultimately in charge of this, has determined that looking at what Manafort did in other contexts-- is relevant to the investigation. And I think you can say exactly the same thing about Cohen. He was-- involved-- indisputably with Trump Organization activities with Russia and negotiations with the Russians. Mr. Cohen is in the middle of a place that's of great interest to the Special Counsel. Anderson Cooper: Is there any recent precedent for p-- prosecuting somebody for an undisclosed campaign contribution? Trevor Potter: As it happens, there is. There's sort of a pretty spectacular one. Former Senator John Edwards was prosecuted, but never convicted, for payments a supporter and his campaign finance chairman made a year before the 2008 election to a woman who'd had Edwards' child. Trevor Potter: I think the Edwards case is not as strong as the facts we have so far in the Trump case. Anderson Cooper: Why do you think the potential case against Cohen or Trump is a stronger case than the Edwards case? Trevor Potter: The timing of it. It wasn't the year before the election. It's right in the middle of the run-up to Election Day. When-- Trump's conduct with women was a prime campaign issue. In fact, it was what everyone was focused on. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders did not respond to our request for comment from the president. But we did receive a letter from Mr. Trump's attorney Charles Harder, who asked that we show on camera and read on air one of the statements Stormy Daniels signed in January, denying reports she'd had an affair with Mr. Trump. It says, in part: \"My involvement with Donald Trump was limited to a few public appearances and nothing more.\" Anderson Cooper: If Stormy Daniels denied the affair in 2011, which you say is a lie, denied the affair in early January 2018, denied the affair in late January of 2018, doesn't that hurt her credibility? I mean, she's lying, she's lying, she's lying. Michael Avenatti: I think there's no question that it calls into question her credibility. I also think that there's no question that when the American people take all of the facts and evidence into consideration, that they are going to conclude that this woman is telling the truth. And Anderson, to the extent that Mr. Cohen and the president have an alternative version of the facts let them come forward and state it unequivocally. Anderson Cooper: But come on. You would not sign statements one, two, three times about something which you knew to be a lie. Michael Avenatti: If the President of the United States' fixer made it clear to me, either directly or indirectly, that I needed to sign it, and I was in the position of Stormy Daniels, I might sign those statements Stormy Daniels: I felt intimidated and s-- honestly bullied. And I didn't know what to do. And so I signed it. Even though I had repeatedly expressed that I wouldn't break the agreement, but I was not comfortable lying. Anderson Cooper: How do we know you're telling the truth? Stormy Daniels: 'Cause I have no reason to lie. I'm opening myself up for, you know, possible danger and definitely a whole lot of s***. Anderson Cooper: But, you know, there is a potential ups-- financial upside maybe somebody will want you to write a book. Maybe, you know, you can go on a bigger tour and make more money-- Stormy Daniels: That's-- Anderson Cooper: --dancing? Stormy Daniels: That's a lot of ifs. I could also get shunned. I mean, I could automatically be alienating half of my fanbase right at this very moment. Anderson Cooper: Jenna Jameson-- another well-known-- adult film actress said recently about you, \"The left looks at her as a whore and just uses her to try to discredit the president. The right looks at her like a treacherous rat. It's a lose-lose. Should've kept her trap shut.\" Stormy Daniels: I think that she has a lotta wisdom in those words. Anderson Cooper: The president watches 60 Minutes, if he's watching tonight, what would you say to him?"}

The Privacy Commissioner has found Facebook in breach of the New Zealand Privacy Act. The finding comes after Facebook refused a complainant access to personal information held on the accounts of several other Facebook users. Such investigations are almost always confidential, but the Privacy Commissioner identified Facebook to reveal the \"demonstrated unwillingness\" of the social media company to comply with the law. The Privacy Commission has limited enforcement powers and would usually only reveal the names of the parties involved as a last resort, in a bid to warn the public an organisation is in breach of the legislation. Facebook argued that Privacy Act did not apply to it and it did not have tocomply with the Commissioner's request to review the information thecomplainant asked for. But the commissioner found Facebook was subject to the Privacy Act. \"because it operates in New Zealand and provides services to New Zealanders\". Facebook had failed to properly respond to the complainant's request for information, failed to acknowledge it was subject to the Privacy Act, and did not cooperate with the Commissioner's investigation and statutory demand for information. And because of Facebook's refusal to cooperate, the commissioner was unable to review the material requested by the complainant and could not agree if Facebook was justified in properly withholding information from the complainant, preventing the Commissioner from being able to address the complaint under the statutory process. Related articles: Yesterday, it was also reported that Facebook stock has become so toxic that some investment funds now are lumping the social network in with big polluters and other corporations they consider ethically challenged. Facebook is yet to respond to a request for comment in regard to the local breach."}

Hereâs What to Know The fallout from Facebook’s data scandal involving Cambridge Analytica continues this week, as more information came to light confirming that at least 87 million Facebook users were impacted by hidden data harvesting — an update from the “tens of millions” figure that Facebook previously said were touched by its ongoing privacy crisis. Facebook, which is the largest social media company in the world, admitted today that the number was much higher than previously believed at the bottom of a blog post written by Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer. “In total, we believe the Facebook information of up to 87 million people — mostly in the US — may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica,” he wrote. Third party apps will now be restricted from accessing certain kinds of user information they could previously collect from Facebook features like Events, Groups and Pages. Other changes include updates to the ways third-party apps can collect data related to logins for things like “check-ins, likes, photos, posts, videos, events and groups,” the company’s statement reads. It also says that apps will no longer be allowed to collect personal data such as “religious or political views, relationship status and details, custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness activity, book reading activity, music listening activity, news reading, video watch activity, and games activity.” The social media juggernaut also announced that it has disabled certain features in “search and account recovery” to prevent people’s public profiles from being scraped by “malicious actors.” It is also completely shutting down its Partner Categories, which is “a product that lets third-party data providers offer their targeting directly on Facebook,” the statement says. A new feature is also being added to everyone’s newsfeed — a link at the top of the page that will allow users to see what information apps they use have collected about them, and also allow users to remove those apps if they choose. Facebook pledged to alert those users whose personal data was improperly collected by Cambridge Analytica. While the users affected are mainly in the U.S., the BBC has also reported that about one million of the 87 million users impacted are based in the U.K. Facebook’s announcement that almost 90 million users were affected comes on the heels of the news that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress on April 11. The drama began when the $500 billion company admitted earlier in March that data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica, which has close ties to President Trump’s election campaign and right-leaning megadonors, used data that had been collected from millions of users without their consent. Facebook has since suspended Cambridge Analytica’s access to its platform. Facebook continues to take a beating from commentators and investors alike as its stock keeps plunging — the company’s market cap dropped $50 billion alone during first week that the scandal came to light, becoming its largest ever two-day drop. Meanwhile, lawmakers in the U.S. and the U.K. who demanded Zuckerberg explain his company’s practices may finally get some answers during his testimony next week. Here’s what to know about Facebook’s latest crisis. What is Cambridge Analytica? Cambridge Analytica is a political analysis firm that claims to build psychological profiles of voters to help its clients win elections. The company is accused of buying millions of Americans’ data from a researcher who told Facebook he was collecting it strictly for academic purposes. Facebook allowed Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge who owns a company called Global Science Research, to harvest data from users who downloaded his app. The problem was that Facebook users who agreed to give their information to Kogan’s app also gave up permission to harvest data on all their Facebook friends, as well, according to the Guardian. The breach occurred when Kogan then sold this data to Cambridge Analytica, which is against Facebook’s rules. Facebook says it has since changed the way it allows researchers to collect data from the platform as a result. Christopher Wylie, a whistleblower who worked at Cambridge Analytica before quitting in 2014, claimed on NBC’s Today Show Monday morning that the firm was “founded on misappropriated data of at least 50 million Facebook users.” Wylie added that Cambridge Analytica’s goal was to establish profiling algorithms that would “allow us to explore mental vulnerabilities of people, and then map out ways to inject information into different streams or channels of content online so that people started to see things all over the place that may or may not have been true.” The data firm initially told British Parliament it did not collect people’s information without their content during a hearing in February, but later admitted in a statement to the New York Times that they did in fact obtain the data, though the company claims to have deleted the information as soon as it found out it violated Facebook’s privacy rules. Cambridge Analytica issued a number of press releases in the days following the explosive media reports, saying that it “strongly denies the claims” it acted improperly. “In 2014 we received Facebook data and derivatives of Facebook data from another company, GSR, that we engaged in good faith to legally supply data for research,” the statement reads. “After it subsequently became known that GSR had broken its contract with Cambridge Analytica because it had not adhered to data protection regulation, Cambridge Analytica deleted all the Facebook data and derivatives, in cooperation with Facebook… This Facebook data was not used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump presidential campaign.” Facebook also issued a statement on its website Monday saying that the claim there was a data breach is “completely false” and Facebook users “gave their consent” when they signed up for certain kinds of apps, like the one Kogan exploited for data collection purposes. The social media juggernaut also maintained that “no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.” Who is the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower? Christopher Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica, spoke out about the firm’s practices on the Today Show Monday morning after previously giving an interview to the New York Times. Wylie, who quit the company in 2014, said he believes it’s important for Americans to know what companies are doing with their personal information, as well as whether Cambridge Analytica’s practices influenced the democratic process. “This was a company [Cambridge Analytica] that really took fake news to the next level by powering it with algorithms,” he said in an interview on the Today Show Monday morning. Wylie also claimed that Cambridge Analytica has been in talks with Russian oil companies and employs a psychologist who works on Russia-funded projects. Any ties between Cambridge and Russia could complicate matters for Facebook, which has spent the past several months grappling with accusations that Moscow used it and other social media networks to meddle in the 2016 U.S. elections. In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said Wylie left the company to found a rival firm. “Their source is a former contractor for Cambridge Analytica – not a founder as has been claimed – who left in 2014 and is misrepresenting himself and the company throughout his comments,” the company said. What is Cambridge Analytica’s connection to Steve Bannon? Onetime Trump campaign advisor and Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was previously vice president of Cambridge Analytica’s board, according to the New York Times. Wylie told the Guardian that Bannon was his boss at Cambridge Analytica. Bannon has been involved in propping up right-wing political groups for years, having been the executive chairman and co-founder of Breitbart News, a far right-wing digital publication, until he stepped down from the position in January. Additionally, Republican megadonor and onetime Breitbart News CEO Robert Mercer, who has funded numerous conservative campaigns at every level of government, invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica. His daughter, Rebekah Mercer was also a board member of the political data firm. The Mercers originally supported Ted Cruz’ presidential campaign, but became patrons of the Trump campaign after Cruz bowed out of the 2016 presidential race. He gave a timeline explaining how the improper data harvesting occurred, and said that in 2014 the company changed its practices to limit the ability of “abusive apps” to collect data from users and their other Facebook friends who did not give consent. “In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that more apps should be social…To do this, we enabled people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them….In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends’ data. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends’ data.” Zuckerberg also acknowledged that journalists informed Facebook as early as 2015 that Kogan shared this data with Cambridge Analytica, and said the company subsequently banned Kogan’s apps from the social network because they violated Facebook policies. “This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that,” he wrote on Facebook. He also said the company will investigate all apps that had “access to large amount of information” before the 2014 policy changes, and that Facebook plans to further restrict developers’ access to Facebook users’ data moving forward. The company will also make it easier for users to deny permission to third party developers that collect their personal information. As part of this effort, the company plans to move its privacy tool to the top of the News Feed. Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg shared Zuckerberg’s post on her own Facebook page, saying she “deeply regrets” that the company did not do more to address the problem. Facebook will also start to ban developers who misuse “personally identifiable information” and alert users when Facebook learns their data has been misused, she wrote.

The topic: your data privacy on social networks. It's yet more fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal that has consumed Facebook since the middle of March, but the senatorial inquiry won't be limited to the world's biggest social network. Also on the invitation list for the hearing are Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. \"We have received and are reviewing the invite,\" a Facebook spokesman said.Â Google didn't respond to a request for comment. Twitter declined to comment.Â Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the judiciary committee and a Republican from Iowa, announced the hearing Monday. Scheduled for April 10, it's on the \"future of data privacy in social media.\" More specifically, it will focus on privacy standards for how data is collected by social networks, as well as how it's distributed to third-party groups and for commercial use. The committee wants to see how the data can be misused and what steps Facebook is taking to better protect your personal information.Â Worries about the privacy of consumers' personal data erupted when The New York Times and The Guardian revealed how the information on 50 million Facebook users fell into the hands of Cambridge Analytica, a UK-based election consulting firm. Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing. Lawmakers and regulators in the US and Europe were quick to call for Zuckerberg to stand up and address the issue. In the past, Facebook has sent legal counsels in lieu of Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. Likewise with Google and Twitter, as in the case of congressional inquiries over Russian meddling in the 2016 US elections. \"What we try to do is send the person at Facebook who will have the most knowledge about what Congress is trying to learn,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview with CNN. \"If that's me, then I am happy to go.\" Also on Monday, the US Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook's privacy practices."}

One Liberal source told Guardian Australia: âCultural cringe-style fascination with imported political techniques is something that rightly died 30 years ago in Australia â we have far more sophisticated data and messaging tools here, now, on all sides of politics, which are being successfully exported, not imported.â Another said: âThis is simple information gathering to see whether there is substance behind the companyâs rhetoric.â A Labor figure said party members had heard from data vendors in Australia that Cambridge Analytica had been suggesting during pitches it already had a relationship with the ALP. âThese guys are trying to get a foot in the door but we are about as likely to work with them as we are likely to work with Steve Bannonâs other outlets.â Did Cambridge Analytica influence the Brexit vote and the US election?

The parent company is based in the UK. The reclusive Mercer is also an investor in Breitbart News. Bannon â Trumpâs chief strategist â reportedly persuaded Mercer to invest both in Breitbart News and in the data analytics company. Cambridge Analyticaâs website says it collects up to 5,000 data points on more than 220 million Americans, âand use more than 100 data variables to model target audience groups and predict the behaviour of like-minded peopleâ. The firm uses personality profiling â measuring openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism â to design advertising and political messaging designed to appeal specifically to consumers. It says it uses the personality profiling to âmake unique connections between people who might look different to each other but who deep down are driven by the same needs and want the same thingsâ. The companyâs chief executive, Alexander Nix, has reportedly said: âPersuading somebody to vote a certain way, is really very similar to persuading 14- to 25-year-old boys in Indonesia to not join al-Qaida.â Data firm in talks for role in White House messaging â and Trump business Read more The firm initially worked for Ted Cruzâs campaign, which paid Cambridge Analytica more than $5m to help identify voters in the Iowa caucuses â before switching to the Trump campaign.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is probing whether Facebook violated terms of a 2011 consent decree after the recent revelations that user data had been transferred to Cambridge Analytica without those users' knowledge, according to a person familiar with the matter. Advertisement Under the 2011 settlement, Facebook agreed to get user consent for certain changes to privacy settings as part of a settlement of federal charges that it deceived consumers and forced them to share more personal information than they intended. That complaint arose after the company changed some user settings without notifying users, the FTC said at the time. An FTC spokeswoman said Tuesday in emailed statement that the agency is aware of the issues that have been raised but can't comment on whether it is investigating. The agency takes any allegations of violations of consent decrees seriously, the statement said. If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company more than $40,000 a day per violation. Facebook said in a statement that it rejects \"any suggestion of violation of the consent decree.\" \"We respected the privacy settings that people had in place,\" it said. \"Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\" Facebook stock fell, retreating 3.2% to $167 around 8 a.m. PDT. That follows a drop of 6.8% on Monday, which was the stock's biggest one-day loss in four years. Even though several Republicans and Democrats have expressed concern about Cambridge Analytica's use of the data, GOP-controlled congressional committees haven't demanded hearings with Facebook executives. The Senate Commerce Committee did announce Monday evening that it would like a briefing from the company on \"the use and sharing of individual Facebook user data.\" Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also said he was considering a hearing with the chief executives of Facebook, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Twitter Inc. The Facebook revelations have also prompted transatlantic reactions. The chairman of a British parliamentary committee announced Tuesday he was requesting that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg â who has remained silent for days â appear before the panel to supplement prior testimony by the company's executives. White House spokesman Raj Shah said Tuesday that Trump \"believes that Americans' privacy should be protected\" and supports federal investigations into the incident. \"If Congress wants to look into the matter or other agencies want to look into the matter, we welcome that,\" Shah said on Fox News. Asked if Zuckerberg should testify, Shah demurred. \"Without knowing the specifics, it's difficult to talk about whether an individual should testify,\" he said. A Facebook spokesman confirmed that the company would be holding a town hall meeting Tuesday, where a deputy general counsel would answer questions.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook on Wednesday slammed Facebook for profiting from its users' data â and called for the social media giant to be more tightly regulated. Such detailed profiles of people, with \"incredibly deep personal information that is patched together from several sources\" like Facebook has compiled, shouldn't be allowed to exist, Cook said. \"I think the best regulation is no regulation, is self-regulation,\" Cook said. \"However, I think weâre beyond that here, and I do think that it's time for a set of people to think deeply about what can be done here.\" Cook's comments come as Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, face criticism, lawsuits and political inquiries over how Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm that worked with President Donald Trump's election campaign, was able to acquire the user data of 50 million Facebook users. Speaking at a town hall event hosted by MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Recode's Kara Swisher, Cook said Facebook put profits above all else when it allegedly allowed user data to be taken through connected apps. The event is part of MSNBC's \"Revolution\" series. When asked what he would do if he were in Zuckerberg's position, Cook replied: \"What would I do? I wouldn't be in this situation.\" \"The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product,\" Cook said. \"Weâve elected not to do that.\" \"The truth is we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer, if our customer was our product,\" Cook said. \"Weâve elected not to do that.\" \"Privacy to us is a human right. It's a civil liberty, and something that is unique to America. This is like freedom of speech and freedom of the press,\" Cook said. \"Privacy is right up there with that for us.\" His comments are consistent with Apple's long-held privacy stance â which the company stood by even in the face of a legal quarrel with the U.S. government a couple of years ago, when it refused to help the FBI unlock an iPhone belonging to the man responsible for killing 14 people in San Bernadino, California, in December 2015. Federal officials ultimately backed down, but only because they managed to unlock the phone themselves. \"If that same circumstance arose again, we would fight, because this, again, is a value of America,\" Cook said Wednesday. \"You should not be able to compel somebody to write something that is bad for civilization.\" MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Recode's Kara Swisher talk with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the Revolution: Apple Changing the World town hall in Chicago on March 28, 2018.MSNBC The wide-ranging discussion touched on everything from Apple's latest classroom products and efforts to improve education â Cook urged everyone of all ages to learn how to code to survive the changing jobs market â to politics, to other tech titans. In regards to Amazon's highly publicized competition for \"HQ2,\" its second headquarters in a yet-to-be-determined location, Cook said that Apple would also be bringing more jobs to places around the U.S. â but, he quipped, \"Weâre not doing a beauty contest thing. Thatâs not Apple.\" He also spoke passionately about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which President Donald Trump is pushing to phase out. The Obama-era program shields \"Dreamers,\" hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children, from being deported. \"I donât see this as a partisan issue. This is not about whether youâre red or blue, conservative or liberal. This is about America, right? This is that simple. And so Iâm very disappointed with both parties that they have not acted,\" Cook, who has discussed DACA with Trump, said. \"I'm personally lobbying on this,\" he said. Later, when asked by an audience member what advice he would have given to his high school self, Cook said, \"The truth is we all have the same purpose, and so we should all quit looking. Our purpose is to serve humanity.\" He added: \"I wish I had realized that sooner.\" The full \"Revolution\" interview will air Friday, April 6 at 8 p.m. ET, 5 p.m. PT on MSNBC.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2 Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still donât know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we wonât until Facebook comes clean and notifies users. Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach. Cambridge Analyticaâs CEO called the data the âsecret sauceâ that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics â including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5 For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the companyâs poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebookâs settlement.6 Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are â or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data. We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone â including the Trump campaign â who might potentially use this data from Facebookâs platform."}

In a statement released by Paul Grewal, the companyâs vice president and deputy general counsel, Facebook explained that the suspension was the result of a violation of its platform policies. The company noted that the very unusual step of a public blog post explaining the decision to act against Cambridge Analytica was due to âthe public prominence of this organization.â Facebook claims that back in 2015 Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user information without approval from the social network through work the company did with a University of Cambridge psychology professor named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan developed an app called âthisisyourdigitallifeâ that purported to offer a personality prediction in the form of âa research app used by psychologists.â Apparently around 270,000 people downloaded the app, which used Facebook Login and granted Kogan access to usersâ geographic information, content they had liked, and limited information about usersâ friends. While Koganâs method of obtaining personal information aligned with Facebookâs policies, âhe did not subsequently abide by our rules,â Grewal stated in the Facebook post. âBy passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.â Facebook said it first identified the violation in 2015 and took action â apparently without informing users of the violation. The company demanded that Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie certify that they had destroyed the information. Over the past few days, Facebook said it received reports (from sources it would not identify) that not all of the data Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie collected had been deleted. While Facebook investigates the matter further, the company said it had taken the step to suspend the Cambridge Analytica account as well as the accounts of Kogan and Wylie. Depending on who you ask, UK-based Cambridge Analytica eitherÂ played a pivotal role in the U.S. presidential electionÂ or cooked up an effective marketing myth to spin into future business. Last year, a handful of former Trump aides and Republican consultants dismissed the potency of Cambridge Analyticaâs so-called secret sauce as âexaggeratedâ in a profile by the New York Times. A May 2017 profile in the Guardian that painted the Robert Mercer-funded data company as shadowy and all-powerful resulted in legal action on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. Last October, the Daily Beast reported that Cambridge Analyticaâs chief executive Alexander Nix contacted Wikileaksâ Julian Assange with an offer to helpÂ disseminate Hillary Clintonâs controversial missing emails. In an interview with TechCrunch late last year, Nix said that his company had detailed hundreds of thousands of profiles of Americans throughout 2014 and 2015 (the time when the company was working with Sen. Ted Cruz on his presidential campaign). â¦We used psychographics all through the 2014 midterms. We used psychographics all through the Cruz and Carson primaries. But when we got to Trumpâs campaign in June 2016, whenever it was, there it was there was five and a half months till the elections. We just didnât have the time to rollout that survey. I mean, Christ, we had to build all the IT, all the infrastructure. There was nothing. There was 30 people on his campaign. Thirty. Even Walker it had 160 (itâs probably why he went bust). And he was the first to crash out. So as Iâve said to other of your [journalist] colleagues, clearly thereâs psychographic data thatâs baked-in to legacy models that we built before, because weâre not reinventing the wheel. [Weâve been] using models that are based on models, that are based on models, and weâve been building these models for nearly four years. And all of those models had psychographics in them. But did we go out and rollout a long form quantitive psychographics survey specifically for Trump supporters? No. We just didnât have time. We just couldnât do that. The key implication here is that data leveraged in the Trump campaign could have originated with Kogan before being shared to Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook policy. The other implication is that Cambridge Analytica may not have destroyed that data back in 2015. The tools that Cambridge Analytica deployed have been at the heart of recent criticism of Facebookâs approach to handling advertising and promoted posts on the social media platform. Nix credits the fact that advertising was ahead of most political messaging and that traditional political operatives hadnât figured out that the tools used for creating ad campaigns could be so effective in the political arena. âThereâs no question that the marketing and advertising world is ahead of the political marketing the political communications world,â Nix told TechCrunch last year. ââ¦There are some things which [are] best practice digital advertising, best practice communications which weâre taking from the commercial world and are bringing into politics.â Responding to the allegations, Cambridge Analytica sent the following statement. In 2014, SCL Elections contracted Dr. Kogan via his company Global Science Research (GSR) to undertake a large scale research project in the US. GSR was contractually committed to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR were also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. The language in the SCL Elections contract with GSR is explicit on these points. GSR subsequently obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebookâs terms of service, SCL Elections deleted all data it had received from GSR. For the avoidance of doubt, no data from GSR was used in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election. Under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act (Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data), a criminal offense has not been committed if a person has acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain data. GSR was a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding the its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections. It would be entirely incorrect to attempt to claim that SCL Elections illegally acquired Facebook data. Indeed SCL Elections worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that SCL Elections had not knowingly breached any of Facebookâs Terms of Service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com How Trump consultants got banned by Facebook for exploiting millions of usersâ data By Matthew RosenbergThe New York TimesNicholas ConfessoreCarole Cadwalladr Sat., March 17, 2018 LONDON—As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 U.S. midterm elections, it had a problem. The firm had secured a $15 million (U.S.) investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behaviour. But it did not have the data to make its new products work. Christopher Wylie, who helped found the data firm Cambridge Analytica and worked there until 2014, said, âRules donât matter for them. For them, this is a war, and itâs all fair.â Â Â ( ANDREW TESTA / New York Times ) So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social-media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign in 2016. An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic. Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.” Article Continued Below “They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.” Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s psychographic modelling techniques. But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with half a dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove. Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action. “This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Grewal said. Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. Article Continued Below In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators, who are scrutinizing possible data privacy violations and allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. In the United States, Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees. Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election. In late 2013, Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defence contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behaviour. Wylie had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University. Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, Wylie recalled. Through a spokeswoman, Bannon declined to comment. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict voting behaviour. But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. When the c declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was a psychology professor at the university. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records. All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.” He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said. Of those, roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Just as Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a licence to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica. The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European. In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dove into the U.S. midterm elections. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in a U.S. election campaign, the company said. Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business, Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations. All of the scrutiny appears to have affected business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 mid-terms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump’s re-election campaign.

Data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook users in developing techniques to support President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, the New York Times and London's Observer reported on Saturday. The newspapers, which cited former Cambridge Analytica employees, associates and documents, said the data breach was one of the largest in the history of Facebook Inc. Facebook on Friday said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica after finding data privacy policies had been violated. The Observer said Cambridge Analytica used the data, taken without authorization in early 2014, to build a software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. The paper quoted Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who worked with an academic at Cambridge University to obtain the data, as saying the system could profile individual voters to target them with personalized political advertisements. The more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential U.S. voters, at the time, the paper said. \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,\" the Observer quoted Wylie as saying. The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it. The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said. However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers' Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the paper said. It said Facebook's \"platform policy\" allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising. Facebook said on Friday it had suspended Cambridge Analytica and its parent group Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica said GSR \"was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.\" \"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" he said. \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" the spokesman said. He added that \"no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\" The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement, which was attributed to the social network's deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal. \"We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,\" Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims. In a Twitter post, Facebook's Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports \"important and powerful,\" but said it was \"incorrect to call this a 'breach' under any reasonable definition of the term.\" \"We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,\" he said. 'MORE EVIDENCE' On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it \"provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.\" Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, declined to comment on Friday. In past interviews with Reuters, Parscale has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign, and that the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was \"more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West\" and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements. The suspension means Cambridge Analytica and SCL cannot buy ads on the world's largest social media network or administer pages belonging to clients, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, said in a Twitter post. Trump's campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. Cambridge Analytica says it uses \"behavioral microtargeting,\" or combining analysis of people's personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population. It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and it is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups. Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica and two individuals going back to 2015. That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan, the Cambridge University professor, lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data that he acquired with a so-called \"research app\" that used Facebook's login system. Kogan was not immediately available for comment. The app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information \"in a legitimate way\" but \"he did not subsequently abide by our rules\" when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. http://bit.ly/2FZU1Ir Eunoia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan's app when it learned of the violation in 2015, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that \"not all data was deleted,\" prompting the suspension announced on Friday."}

Three congressional committees have invited Zuckerberg to testify, including the Senate Judiciary Committee at an April 10 meeting about data privacy. It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees. A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. âThe committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,â said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez. Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was âhappy to, if itâs the right thing to do.â He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. âWhat I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.â On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panelâs leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having âunderstated the riskâ about the data it holds on its users â and whether it had been taken without consent. Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks. âThe Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,â the panel said. In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if theyâd take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear. Spokespeople for two of the committees â the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee â did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday. Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify. Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebookâs own platforms; he hasnât used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed. Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Appleâs tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Googleâs then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his companyâs size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals. Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senateâs top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take âformalâ action â a subtle threat of a subpoena â that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway. In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation. In the U.S., Facebookâs use of peopleâs data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumersâ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.

Mr. Nix is a director of SCL Group, a British political and defense contractor, and chief executive of its American offshoot,Â Cambridge Analytica, which advised the Trump campaign. The firmsâ employees, who often overlap, had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant. Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature, and SCL also said there were no meetings in London. (...) Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russiaâs president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what â or which client â prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putinâs popularity to Russian expansionism. (...) ... Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the companyâs voter-profiling technology, said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters. âI remember being super confused,â said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings. âI kept asking Alexander, âCan you explain to me what they want?ââ he said, referring to Mr. Nix. âI donât understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.â âWeâre sending them stuff about political targeting â they then come and ask more about political targeting,â Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil âjust didnât seem to be interestedâ in how the techniques could be used commercially. (...) Though Lukoil is not state-owned, it depends on Kremlin support, and its chief executive, Vagit Alekperov,Â has metÂ with Mr. Putin on a number of occasions. Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companiesÂ received instructionsÂ from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership. The chief executive of Lukoil, Vagit Alekperov, is a former Soviet oil minister who has said the strategic aims of Lukoil are closely aligned with those ofÂ Russia. âI have only one task connected with politics, to help the country and the company. Iâm not close to Mr Putin, but I treat him with great respect,â he told theÂ New York Times. In addition, Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University researcher who harvested Facebook data for Cambridge Analytica \"had previously unreported ties to a Russian university, including a teaching position and grants for research into the social media network.\" ...[W]hile he was helping turnÂ FacebookÂ profiles into a political tool he was also an associate professor at St Petersburg State University, taking Russian government grants to fund other research into social media. (...) Kogan told theÂ Observer: âNothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way. No data or models.â His recollection was that the Russia project had started a year after his collaboration with Cambridge Analytica ended."}

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: The British data mining firm Cambridge Analytica has suspended its CEO as investigations gear up in Great Britain and the United States. The firm allegedly obtained data from millions of Facebook users and used that data to help President Trump get elected in 2016. NPR's Peter Overby gives us a look at some of the potential legal problems here. PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: In an undercover video by television 4 News (ph) in England, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix took credit for almost everything in the Trump campaign except the make America great again hats. He said his firm did all the data, research, analytics and targeting, the digital campaign and the television campaign, and, quote, \"our data informed all the strategy.\" The firm did this in part with data mined from 50 million Facebook users. So here's a question. BRETT KAPPEL: Did Cambridge Analytica give any of that information, any of that data to the Trump campaign? Did they actually give them the data? OVERBY: Brett Kappel is a campaign finance lawyer in D.C. The question matters because Donald J. Trump For President paid Cambridge Analytica less than $6 million for the entire campaign. Estimates for the Facebook data run into the tens of millions. If it's really that much, then the campaign got an extremely expensive and highly illegal contribution from a corporation, and a foreign corporation at that. The FEC is timid about a lot of things, but Kappel notes this. KAPPEL: The Federal Election Campaign Act's prohibition on foreign national contributions is the broadest prohibition in the entire statute. OVERBY: Here's another issue. It's illegal for foreign nationals to hold decision-making positions in American elections. Remember the CEO's list of all the things Cambridge Analytica did? If any of it involved decision-making, such as going ahead with an ad buy, that could be a problem. It's worth noting that corporate and foreign contributions are two of the core prohibitions most likely to get the attention of Justice Department prosecutors. Cambridge Analytica had a second client, a pro-Trump superPAC called Make America Number 1, also known as Stop Crooked Hillary PAC (ph), which indicates its mission in the general election campaign. Cambridge Analytica treated the campaign committee and the superPAC as one project. It's a violation of campaign finance law to coordinate messaging between a campaign and a superPAC, but the FEC says a company can serve both clients if it creates two teams and walls them off from each other. That's what Cambridge Analytica says it did, so this arrangement that seems obviously dicey probably isn't. Peter Overby, NPR News, Washington.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43444791","title":"Trump campaign data firm accused of harvesting Facebook data - BBC News","text":"The attorney general for the US state of Massachusetts is launching an investigation into alleged harvesting of Facebook profiles by a firm employed by Donald Trump's election campaign. Investigations by the Observer and New York Times newspapers claim details from 50 million profiles were gathered without the users' knowledge. The company, Cambridge Analytica, was suspended from Facebook on Friday. Both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica deny any wrongdoing. The American data analysis firm - which is not associated with the famous British university - is well known for the role it played in President Trump's election campaign, where it provided intricate data on the thoughts of American voters. Allegations against it centre on a professor from the University of Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan, who designed a personality testing Facebook app called thisisyourdigitallife. The app was a private enterprise, and not part of his university work. The app, created in November 2013 for the Facebook platform, asked users for permission to access their profile information - and also that of their friends'. It is alleged that Mr Kogan then sold that data on to Cambridge Analytica, in violation of Facebook's policies. \"We exploited Facebook... and built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on,\" he said. How did it access so many profiles? Image copyrightGetty Images Mr Kogan's app requested permission from people taking his personality quiz to access some information from their Facebook profiles. About 265,000 people had downloaded the app at the time - and it also asked for permission to request \"more limited information\" from the user's friends. Facebook says this \"is no longer possible\" - but at the time, such a request was controlled by the privacy settings of that user's friends. So if a user had their account set to allow sharing with a friend's apps, and the friend gave permission to Mr Kogan's app, it could read some information. Facebook's policies, however, said that this data can only be used for the app's stated purpose - and cannot be transferred or sold on. \"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,\" the company said. Britain's Observer newspaper reports that the incident was known about more than two years ago. But the newspaper said Facebook's action to ban Cambridge Analytica and its parent group SCL this week happened four days after its reporters contacted the social network for comment about its upcoming story. On Saturday, as the story emerged in newspapers, the UK Information Commissioner, the country's main data protection regulator, said it was \"investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used\". However, the statement did not mention Mr Kogan, his company, or Cambridge Analytica, instead saying it was part of an \"ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes\"."}
{"originalUrl":"https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-vs-the-big-four-92829cb42bb1","title":"Blockchain vs The Big Four â Hacker Noon","text":"But with so many opinions and noise floating around, I thought it would be beneficial to take a deep dive on the ramifications of blockchain technology as it relates to todayâs top tech companies. Will blockchain based alternatives unseat Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple? After in-depth research into the business models, here is what I foundâ¦ A quick explanation For those new to the space, blockchains are immutable (unchangeable), often trustless ledgersâââcreating digital scarcity and the possibly for much more. Due to their decentralized nature (run by a community vs a single entity) and their economic incentive models (tokens), they potentially represent a major threat to the status quoâââat least that is what enthusiasts would have us believe (more on this later in article). Basically this means that anything that was once done/stored on paper can now be accomplished and recorded on the blockchain, creating an infinite and unchangeable âpaperâ trail of ownership records, programmable contracts, financial information, personal data and much more. And at least in theory, it would be owned by the usersâââsomething unheard of today. The GAFA techÂ gods As we enter 2018, we are entering into an era of unparalleled tech dominance. Companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple control more and more of our everyday livesâââowning our data and everything around it. The inherent network effects and flywheels these companies built are unprecedentedâââboth in their scope and ability to stave off competition. In this connected world where things are constantly changing, I thought it could be beneficial to analyze/theorize blockchain based competitors to combat the tech giants of todayâââspecifically to focus on what it would take to win. Google (For a in-depth analysis of Googleâs core business model, strengths and weaknesses, future focuses and potential acquisitions, see this post) Google is one of the most complicated companies today, with dozens of divisions and products that dominate our daily life. We will skip most of these areas and instead focus on their primary business modelâââadvertising. 1. GoogleÂ Search Google is the dominant search engine with over 77% of global searches going through Google (Source: NetMarketShare.com). Despite the fact that 1.3B people (there are only 7.6B people globally) live behind Chinaâs Firewall, Google still owns over Â¾ of the search engine market. This dominance has fueled Googleâs historic rise. 2. Youtube Youtube is the second largest search engine in the world, and easily the largest user generated video platform. Users upload an impossible 100 hours of content to Youtube every minute. And Credit Suisse believes that in 2015, Youtube and Google Play accounted for ~15% of Googleâs revenue (up from 4% in 2010), and forecasted to reach 24% by 2020. Considering Google only paid $1.65B to acquire them in 2006, that is one hell of a deal. 3. AdSenseâââdisplay advertising The other piece of Googleâs advertising supremacy is their partner network, AdSense. AdSense allows sites to monetize through Googleâs advertising platform without worrying about the backend or finding advertisers. Instead Google handles everything and takes a between 32 and 49 percent of ad revenue generate (the rest going to publishers). According to Investopedia, AdSense revenues accounted for $15.5B, ie 23% of Googleâs total revenue in 2016. Unfortunately advertising as a business focuses on eyeballs over quality, leading to much of the degradation and click baity titles of today. I donât see the advertising model changing drastically anytime soon, meaning Googleâs great success with AdSense is likely to continue (and grow). How blockchain beatsÂ Google Googleâs business is all about eyeballs, attention and âsupposed transparency.â Their slogan of âdonât be evilâ and mission to openly share information with the world are notably atÂ odds. This creates a scenario where Googleâs platform is god and only those that play by his/her rules are allowed in the garden of Google. But, crypto complicates things for Google. Googleâs dominance is primarily driven by the network effects of big data and AI combined with force of habitâââa near perfect storm. At the same time however, many in the tech community are worried about the role tech giants play in our lives, especially as it relates to selling our personal data. And as we have seen, the tech community is taking some shots from politicians and users over their role in the recent US election. 1. Search A blockchain based browser/search engine could solve the problem of misaligned incentives. I have started using DuckDuckGo (a privacy focused search engine) after my research for the book (The Big FourâââHow Todayâs Tech Companies Monopolize the Future) revealed the extent of Googleâs power and control over my life. NOTE:DuckDuckGo has only a 0.20% market share worldwide (SourceâââNetMarketShare) DDGâs approach has major advantages for users, namely disintermediating value with personal dataâââbut there are issues as well. The reason Google is dominates is their data and AI expertise. They know us better than we know ourselves and are able to deliver better experiences as a result. It is the reason Antitrust action will almost never occur in the USâââour definition of monopoly is based upon consumer price gouging and poor experiencesâââthe opposite of what todayâs top tech companies deliver. You want the best results for you, and you want them now. Google delivers this. A blockchain based search engine (BBSE) could theoretically win here. Combined with an identity coin like Citizen, a BBSE could use consumer data and preferences (without ever owning/controlling them) to display better, more personalized search results for users. And if advertising was added, BBSE users would benefit as well, earning tokenized âcommissionsâ in exchange for seeing the adsâââremoving the adversarial relationship that exists today. Unfortunately I foresee this as being a long ways off. To change user behavior, you need a 5â10x better solut than the existing product. To get to the point where a BBSE which surpasses Googleâs market share (currently 77â80%) will take years. Most people too freely give up their data and information without reading the terms of service (myself included). 2. Video Competing with Youtube presents many of the same challenges as tackling search. There is one major advantage however, the creators create the platform and value. And because Youtube advertising isnât effective for the vast majority of creators, this could be interesting. âAccording to our analysis, the average CPM that can be expected from YouTube videos is between $0.50 and $5.00. That means that for every 1 million views of your videos, you can expect to make between $500 and $5,000.ââââMonetizeÂ Pros Because Youtube is so competitive and the ability to earn is limited, it makes logical sense that creators would cross-populate content. On a new blockchain based video platform (BBVP), there would be less competition and thus a greater percentage of attention. If incentives were added for creators to create content and onboard audiences, the rewards suddenly get more interesting. The first mover advantages create inherent network effects and time urgencyâââbring over your subscribers before some other Youtuber does. That said it would still take time, especially to bring sufficient eyeballs to make good money. But with strong enough token incentives and quality content, it seems safe to say that news would spread. The question is how fast. Odds are a BBVP would take several years to mature. Youtube has over 100 hours of video uploaded every minuteâââthat is a lot of evergreen, SEO rich content. And because Google favors Youtube, it would be hard to steal search traffic. NOTE: Steemit/Dtube is currently working on building a Youtube killer but has a long long way to go to create a credible threat. That said Steemit is one of the most active blockchain projects/cryptocurrencies with a market cap of $1.49B and processes over 1M transactions per day (820k/day as of July 2017)âââthings are happening! 3. Adsense Advertising ruined the internet, and journalism. When the world switched from subscriptions to display ads, quality started to slide. Today clickbait is king. More eyeballs and pageviews (hence those annoying freaking slideshows) has created a world where artificial attention is rewarded. We have seen the quality of journalism and content degradeâââprioritizing provocative headlines, flashy thumbnails and accidentally promoting an asshole like Trump. NOTE:Trump won because he created controversy, driving eyeballs (ie ad dollars) and thus rankings/ratings around the globe. Our disgust forced us to read and forced his image and message everywhere like an unescapable evil billboard. A blockchain based publication model (BBPM) could in theory solve this. Medium does a decent job of illustrating the point (although not profitably), by allowing users to upvote/Clap for articles they enjoy (up to 50 Claps). A similar model could redistribute dollars to the sites and publications we appreciate most. And there are companies/organizations trying to do just that, both with and without blockchains. This is a hard proposition though because the majority donât understand the power/risk of personal information. Most people are fine with âbeing the productâ and profiting ( receivingfree content/access) for their contribution to theÂ system. In my opinion the one and only way a blockchain based answer to Adsense could succeed would be tokenized incentives for early adopters (users and publishers) to the system where Adsense ads had an if/then statement attached. If user is BBPM member, no ads. If not then display ads. In order to participate in the BBPM, publishers could jointly collude to âmonopolizeâ the market, creating a linearly sliding scale of advertising intrusiveness across all web properties to encourage laggards to convert (ie overtime sites across the internet become less and less usable and more and more ads/spammy until readers joined the BBPM) That said, I donât see a âmafia-likeâ approach like this being adopted or believe change can happen in under a generation (hard to go from free to paid and be okay with it). Hopefully I kids help kill clickbaitâ¦ Amazon The company Bezos built to sell books online is now arguably the most dominant and diversified company on earth, and the odds on favorite to crack the $1T market cap first. This seems to be the consensus, at least among technologists. But the majority are often very wrong, so letâs dive deeper (see the article below for a more in-depth analysis of Amazonâs future). Understanding theÂ empire Amazonâs business is made up of five primary divisions: Amazon.com, AWS, Alexa, Whole Foods Market and Amazon Prime. Each on its own would be an impressive business. Combined they create the worldâs largest flywheel. I donât believe Alexa, Whole Foods or Amazon Prime have any risk of blockchain based disruption (at least in the foreseeable future). The nature of these business models isnât easily decentralized. And while decentralized AI/compute could be an interesting component to building an Alexa killer, I believe the bulk of the effort to be merging multiple technologies and disciplines (voice, AI, APIs, hardware) which seem highly unlikely in the foreseeable future 1. Amazon.com Amazonâs is the most monopolistic and well positioned marketplace the Western world has ever seen. Last year they did $136B in revenue with double digit growth every year. 2017 estimates show a staggering 44% of US ecommerce occurred on Amazon.com (Source: Recode). And Amazon has been growing at least 13% YoY (year-over-year) for each of the last 5 years. It isnât just a monopoly, it is accelerating. But there is another layer to unpackâââAmazon Basics, where Amazon analyzes 3rd party seller data and copies the best performing products. Ultimately Amazon wants to replace ALL 3rd party sellers/products with Amazon Basics versions. Amazon wants to (and will) own the customer, and every ounce of margin that comes with it. Today ~42% of the web is powered by AWS. That is more than double Microsoft, Google and IBM (combined). Yet given the easy to use system and affordable pricing, it makes sense. And growth isnât slowing, quite the opposite actually. AWS accounts for 10% of Amazonâs overall revenue, with $4.6B in Q3 of 2017 (up 42% over last year) and $1.2B in profit (up 36% over last year). Source: GeekWire Amazon owns the infrastructure the majority of the internet is built on, can decentralization change that? How blockchain beatsÂ Amazon I have my money on Amazon. They are the best positioned of the tech giants to own the future. That said, blockchain can create challenges for Bezosâ beast, it depends how it is implemented, incentivized and evolves. 1. Ecommerce While Amazon owns ecommerce today, there are many projects focused on building decentralized marketplaces. Most miss the point though. The issue isnât Amazonâs ~15%+ transaction fee, that is par for the course and the cost of doing business. And besides, consumers could care less how much sellers pay in fees, it doesnât affect them. (Plus 10% is a fraction of the 5â10x improvement needed to switchâââit wouldnât be meaningful enough for sellers to abandon Amazon entirely). Yes, sellers care about fees, but what is more important is control. As referenced previously, Amazon sellers (like myself previouslyâââmore on my backstory here) play on Amazonâs playground. You never knew if/when you will be uninvitedâââor Amazon could copy your product (Amazon Basics) and cut youÂ out. This creates a constant fear of suspension. If 80%+ of your business is on Amazon, what happens if you lose access? A decentralized marketplace NEEDS to be built first and foremost by sellers. That is doable in my opinion. Most sellers would do ANYTHING to control their companyâs destiny. If that means promoting a blockchain based ecommerce platform (BBEP), you can bet your ass they wouldâââeven without tokenized incentives. Adding incentives further accelerates adoption among sellers. But buyers is another story. Here tokenized âdiscountsâ or âbonusesâ could be used to lure buyers to the platform. The challenge is that most sellers cannot easily access their customer base on Amazon. And to contact them and try to bring them off-Amazon can result in suspension. Plus sellers wouldnât want to send their own customers (ie from their standalone site or email list) to an unproven, competitive marketplace, unless it was as an affiliate for other products. Here an Amazon Affiliates type program would be necessary (ie: I sell X and recommend Y related products to past customers on the BBEP, earning tokens for each signup/sale). This could also be employed for heavily incentivized buyer-to-buyer and publisher-to-buyer referral programs to get customers âin-the-door.â If sufficient supply and trust was built, the platform would start to take off, with crypto-economics driving adoption. If the user experience is inferior however, this would take a lot of time. Plus consider the options. If Amazon has 100x the product selection, why would consumers use a BBEP? You need better prices or a huge token incentivizes initiallyâââor todayâs massive âspeculative-esqueâ belief in the business and team to drive token appreciation. 2. File storage & webÂ services To be honest, decentralized file storage seems like overkill for many applications. With dirt cheap cheap AWS/S3 file storage, you need a compelling case to justify relatively unproven blockchain based web services (BBWS). Currently the only use case that seems valuable is decentralized file storage for other decentralized apps and protocols. When full decentralization is necessary (or wanted), it makes sense to use a service like Sia or Storj. But even then, it will take time to scale the eco-system, ie primary customer base. Without enough dApp traction, who will blockchain based storage systems (BBSS) serve? This creates a bit of a chicken-egg scenarioâ¦ Storj claims a fully decentralized storage system where users are able to buy/rent harddrive space autonomously will make that storages cost 10â100x cheaper than centralized solutions. I am a bit skeptical. To store 1T of data on Storj today costs $15/mo plus additional bandwidth fees (for downloads). Google Drive is a flat $10 for that same Terrabyte (plus comes with all the additional functionality of Google Docs etcâ¦) Compared to AWS S3, Storj does better. While AWS/S3 is $0.023/GB/mo, Storj is only $0.015/GB/mo. But that is only a 34% improvement, well shy of the 5â10x improvement typically needed to switch products/service providers. That said, some of the top VCs like Union Square Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Andressen Horowitz all invested in Filecoin so maybe I am totally wrong here. A BBSS is the simplest blockchain model to understand. Users are easily incentivized to provide storage space and customers/enterprises can save a little money on storage. But usually when an opportunity is obvious, it isnât a great opportunity and becomes pretty competitive, so only time will tellâ¦ Facebook As of June 2017, Facebook hit an unprecedented 2B MAUs (monthly active users). That is nearly â  of the population. While there are several divisions within Facebook (thanks to a few successful acquisitions), Facebook is at its core a social media and communications company. We will focus on Facebook.com, Instagram and Whatsapp/Facebook Messenger as these are their three primary businesses and those most ripe for blockchain disruption. (For a deeper dive into Facebook and the future of the company, see this longform breakdown and analysis) 1. Facebook.com Facebook has over 2B monthly active usersâââyet despite the massive market penetration, they are still growing 16% year-over-year. How is that possible? Source: TechCrunch This is due in large part to the brilliant leadership of Mark Zuckerberg where Facebook bet the farm on mobileâââit worked. They were able to go from ~135M MAUs (mobile only) in early-mid 2012 to over 1.15B in Q4 of 2016. The lionshare of growth has been mobile advertisingâââwith mobile now accounting for 86% of their revenueâââbetter than ANYONE expected. Today digital advertising is a duopoly, with Google and Facebook attracting between 57â84% of global digital (outside of China) depending on source.(SourceâââFT.com, Recode). Scarier still is the fact that the duopoly is taking >99% of new growth is digital ad spend (as of Q3 2016). Source: Fortune 2. Instagram Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 for a $1B for a pre-revenue company with 30M users (formed only 2 years prior). After waiting 3 years to monetize (to focus on growth), Instagram turned on ads and became a cash cow. And with 100M new MAUs every 6 months, Instagram is exploding in popularity. Copying Snapchat Stories certainly helped (which Zuck was 100% happy to ripâââpixel by pixel). NOTE:Snapâs stock has dropped 50% since the ill timed (controversial and greedy) IPO. Plus Instagram addresses a different market (millennials) and use case than the Facebookâ building their advertising base even larger. Source: eMarketer 3. Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger NOTE: I refuse to consider Facebook messenger a messaging app as it is just the messaging feature of Facebookâââthus messages from Facebook come through and grossly distort the usage numbers. Either way Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger are the two largest âmessaging appsâ worldwide. Facebook bought Whatsapp in February of 2014 for a whopping $19B, which again seemed absurd. But Facebookâs business has ALWAYS been built around attention, eyeballs and waiting to monetize. And if Instagram is any indication, they know what they are doing. Stern Agee, the financial services company estimates Whatsapp could be generating close to $5B in revenue with over 2.3B users by 2023. I would go bigger. Due to Whatsappâs more private, intimate nature, it creates growth opportunities that an outward facing site like Facebook and to some extent Instagram cannot match. Essentially even if/as people become more reserved about social media, sharing and controlling their data, Whatsapp can still winââârigging the game in Facebookâs favor. How blockchain beatsÂ Facebook Of all the Big Four, blockchain poses the largest threat to Facebook. Facebookâs business is built upon attention, advertising and collecting user data. A network out of Harvard originally built for college hookups is now worth $524Bâââand users never saw a dime. They see quite a few ads though. 1. Facebook.com A decentralized version of Facebook seems obvious at this point. In a social ecosystem without a centralized party, algorithms can be optimized for user happiness, rather than engagement. The biggest problem with Facebook (and Google) is that they are advertising based businesses. Facebook makes their money on impressions, making it more and more user hostile over time to drive ad revenues. From a purely economic standpoint, this means Zuck wants users on Facebook as close to 24 hrs a day as humanly possible. Obviously this isnât sustainable, and studies show social media usage (especially Facebook) have a net negative impacts on happiness. In the long term this is not sustainable for Facebookâââthe more you use Facebook, the worse you feel. Russian election hacking and Jew hate based targeting aside, Facebook could have a serious problem on its hands if more and more users start to churnâââwhich appears to be the case. Why else would Facebook be actively trying to reduce user addiction? Enter a blockchain based competitorâ¦ The token incentive structure should be pretty straightforward. Like Airbnbâs refer a friend and you both get $10 credit, a blockchain based social network (BBSN) could rewards users with BBSN tokens for referrals, creating popular content, posting daily etcâ¦ Tokens could represent virtual economies in the network (buying/selling stickers, access to certain bonuses, or even upvote/downvote micro payments) or they could be positioned as advertising prerequisites, where users could âsellâ their attention or engagement to advertisers. It seems highly likely a BBSN will pop up to compete with Facebook. The question is, will tokenized incentives be enough to overcome Facebookâs enormous network effect? I believe yes, but think it will take at least Â½ a generation. 2. Instagram Same as above, plus with the added bonus of influencers. Because Instagram is more focused on one-to-many communication, users that build followings could sell access tokens to advertisers looking to promote products in a more transparent and simple fashion. Although outside of the target market here, I would give a blockchain based social photo site (BBSPS) a decent chance at gaining significant traction 3. Whatsapp The odds of a blockchain based messaging app (BBMA) taking off are pretty slim. There are so many messaging apps, why build a blockchain based one? Most messaging apps are encrypted anyways so the trust and security level is relatively high. The big challenge however is scale. As of July 2017, there were over 55B Whatsapp messages sent every day (SourceâââAndroidPolice). Crypto kitties crashed Ethereumâs network, and that was only a few hundred thousand âtransactionsâ. But cryptocurrencies built on a centralized service is a different story. The popular messaging app Kik just completed a successful ICO, raising $98M to build a âKINâ currency into their app. With 300M users as of May 2016, it is no surprise that Kik had to quickly switch off ethereumâs net to handle their volume. Rumors are circulating that Facebook may be looking to (or starting to) implement Litecoin for p2p payments. This would be a landmark moment not just for Facebook but for cryptocurrencyâââbringing decentralized, non-governmental payments to the masses. If this is the case, Facebook could set itself up as the dominant p2p payment system. Here is why. The banking and financial services infrastructure is old, outdated and expensive. Even newer, leaner companies like Paypal charge $0.30 + 2.9% on every transaction they process. And Venmo is in the process of starting to charge as well. And while these may seem tiny, especially compared to traditional banking, cryptocurrencies unlock a totally new dimension of moneyâââone that approach 0% fees with no middlemen or hoops to jump through. As we have seen, the peer-to-peer payments market is exploding, forecasted to reach $86B in 2018 in the US alone. And with global mobile payments expected to exceed $930B, this opportunity dwarfs the digital advertising space. If Facebook goes big on implementing either an established cryptocurrency or creating FBcoin, they could own the messaging and p2p payments spaces. Apple Apple is the most valuable company and arguably the most beloved brand worldwide. It is also a money printing machine to the tune of $215B in 2016. And that was a down yearâ¦ And up until recently, consumers were also lied to concerning the âupgradeabilityâ of iPhone parts. No one knew iPhone batteries were interchangeableâ¦ I cannot see a company so focused on secrecy adapting well to blockchain based applications and transparency. That said, Apple has better security than their Android counterparts which will be increasingly important as consumers store cryptographic assets directly on their mobile devices. If Apple adapts, this could be a big win. If not, it could accelerate their undoingâââespecially because ALMOST everything depends on the iPhone ecosystem. Closing thoughts Blockchain technology is creating an interesting and ever changing world. While we have seen hundreds of ICOs promising everything under the sun, little has actually been accomplished or implemented to date. And though I am bullish on blockchain in the long run, I believe we are headed for a coming crypto winter where teams build, markets (and market caps) crash and only the strong survive. Thinning the herd will benefit the community, forging stronger teams and bonds among blockchain devs and the ecosystem at large. The big questions to be answered are timeline and scale. Crypto enthusiasts claim Bitcoin and blockchain are the best thing since sliced bread, but actions speak louder than words. What are your thoughts? Which tech companies are you betting on and where do you see dApps, tokenization and blockchain based tech taking over the world?

Alexander Nix told members of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)Committee last month the company had not collected personal information from individuals without their consent through Facebook apps. The company also denies it used the information to aid Donald Trumpâs 2016 US presidential run, when it was hired by his campaign in order to target potential swing voters. In a statement, Mr Collins said the committee would contact Mr Nix in light of the allegations and ask him to explain his previous comments. âIt seems clear that he has deliberately misled the Committee and Parliament by giving false statements,â the Folkestone and Hythe MP added. âData has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns. âFacebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it, and deliberately avoided answering straight questions from the committee about it.â Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, a former research director at the firm, alleges information on Facebook users was collected by Cambridge University professor Dr Aleksandr Kogan through an app he created in 2014, called âthisisyourdigitallifeâ. Facebook claim that Dr Koganâs company, Global Science Research (GSR), then broke the siteâs privacy rules by passing the data onto third parties, including Cambridge Analytica. The app, which offered users a small sum of money to take a personality test, was downloaded by 270,000 people. However, it is claimed those who did sign up unwittingly gave GSR access to their friendsâ information â meaning tens of millions of people could have had their data harvested. Mr Collins also said the committee had ârepeatedly askedâ Facebook if companies acquired and held data taken from users without their consent, adding the social media giant had âconsistently understatedâ the potential risk.

{"originalUrl":"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voters-who-stayed-home-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/","title":"Registered Voters Who Stayed Home Probably Cost Clinton The Election | FiveThirtyEight","text":"Registered Voters Who Stayed Home Probably Cost Clinton The Election Registered voters who didnât vote on Election Day in November were more Democratic-leaning than the registered voters who turned out, according to a post-election poll from SurveyMonkey, shared with FiveThirtyEight. In fact, Donald Trump probably would have lost to Hillary Clinton had Republican- and Democratic-leaning registered voters cast ballots at equal rates. Election-year polls understandably focus on likely voters. Then, after the election, the attention turns to actual voters, mainly using exit polls. But getting good data on Americans who didnât vote is more difficult. Thatâs why the SurveyMonkey poll, which interviewed about 100,000 registered voters just after Election Day, including more than 3,600 registered voters who didnât vote, is so useful.1 Itâs still just one poll, and so its findings arenât gospel, but with such a big sample we can drill down to subgroups and measure the demographic makeup of nonvoters to an extent we couldnât with a smaller dataset. Letâs look first at the most newsworthy finding: Registered voters who identified as Democrats and independents were more likely than Republicans to stay home. 2016 REGISTERED VOTERS SELF IDENTIFICATION SHARE REGISTERED TO VOTE VOTED IN 2016 ELECTION DIDNâT VOTE DIFFERENCE Democratic 44% 44% 35% +9 Republican 43 46 32 +14 Neither 13 10 33 -23 Registered voters who didnât vote were less Republican-leaning Percentages are rounded. From a survey of 99,377 registered voters and 3,604 registered voters who didnât vote, conducted from Nov. 9-10, 2016 Source: Surveymonkey Given how closely party identification tracks with vote choice, the disparity in turnout probably cost Clinton the election. SurveyMonkey did not ask non-voters whom they would have voted for, but we do know that more than 90 percent of self-identified Democrats who cast a ballot voted for Clinton and more than 90 percent of Republicans voted for Trump. Moreover, voters who didnât identify with or lean towards either party were slightly more likely to prefer Clinton to Trump. That means that had the non-voters cast a ballot in accordance with their party identification, Clinton’s advantage over Trump nationally would have expanded by about 2 to 3 percentage points. That almost certainly would have been enough to flip enough states for her to win the Electoral College. The large gap in party identification between registered voters who cast a ballot and those who didnât also helps to explain why pre-election polling underestimated Trump. Pre-election polls suggested that the gap between these two groups would be smaller than in 2012; the SurveyMonkey data suggests it was larger. The biggest reason given by non-voters for staying home was that they didnât like the candidates.2 Clinton and Trump both had favorable ratings in the low 30s among registered voters who didnât cast a ballot — both had ratings in the low 40s among those who did vote. Thatâs a pretty sizable difference. So why was Clinton hurt more by non-voters? Trump was able to win, in large part, because voters who disliked both candidates favored him in big numbers, according to the exit polls. Clinton, apparently, couldnât get those who disliked both candidates — and who may have been more favorably disposed to her candidacy — to turn out and vote. The second pattern that jumps out in the SurveyMonkey data: Non-white and Hispanic Americans were more likely to stay home than white voters. Of all voters who cast a ballot in the general election, 25 percent were black, Hispanic, Asian, or a member of another minority group. But those voters were 42 percent of those who didnât vote. Drilling down a little further, black voters made up 11 percent of voters who cast a ballot and 19 percent who didnât. This disparity really hurt Clinton because black voters (by 82 percentage points) and Hispanic voters (by 40 percentage points) overwhelmingly favored her, while white voters went for Trump by a 16-point margin in the SurveyMonkey poll. The turnout rate for black voters was substantially higher in 2012, the last time Barack Obama was on the ballot. According to the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey,3 black Americans made up 13 percent of voters and only 9 percent of registered non-voters in 2012. In other words, black voters actually made up a larger percentage of voters who cast a ballot than those who didnât in 2012, which is the opposite of what occurred last year. Whites, on the other hand, made up about the same percentage of registered voters who cast a ballot (74 percent) and those who didn’t (73 percent). The higher number of black non-voters in 2016 probably had a big impact. Next up: Younger voters were more likely to stay home than older voters. That matches a similar pattern from 2012, according to the Current Population Survey. That probably didn’t help Clinton, but it’s not as harmful as you might think because the difference in voting patterns between the oldest age cohort (a group Trump won by 12 percentage points in the SurveyMonkey data) and youngest (a group Clinton won by 30 percentage points) voters isnât as large as it is between racial groups. Overall, the age breakdown of 2016 voters looks about the same as four years ago. More harmful for Clinton was which young voters stayed home: minorities. Among white voters, voters 18-29 years old made up 30 percent of voters who did not participate in the November election. Among young Hispanic voters, that climbs to 43 percent. Among young black voters, it was an even higher 46 percent. That generally matches the findings of the voter data released in some Southern states showing that young black voters were especially likely to stay home in this election. Younger black voters were far more likely to support Bernie Sanders in the primary, suggesting that there simply was not the enthusiasm for Clinton’s candidacy as there was for Obama’s in 2012. Clintonâs favorable rating, for instance, was about 10 percentage points lower among the youngest black voters compared to the oldest black voters in the SurveyMonkey poll. Perhaps most important is the group that voted in much larger numbers than in 2012: white voters without a college degree. (Trump won this bloc 63 percent to 32 percent.) Generally speaking, college graduates are more likely to vote than non-college graduates, even when controlling for race. According to the Current Population Survey, whites without a college degree made up 44 percent of voters who cast a ballot in 2012, and 58 percent of registered voters who didn’t vote. These may have been some of the âmissingâ white voters that RealClearPolitics Sean Trende has written about, but in 2016, they werenât missing. In the SurveyMonkey data, white non-college graduates made up 48 percent of 2016 registered voters who didn’t vote, substantially lower than 2012. They made up 47 percent of voters. Itâs pretty remarkable that a group of voters that is shrinking as a percentage of the population made up a larger share of the electorate in 2016 than in 2012. But Trump made a clear appeal to this group, and some voters who stayed at home in previous years may have felt they had a greater voice in 2016. Simply put, Trump got more of his voters to turn out than Clinton did. Thatâs quite a turnaround from the pre-election conventional wisdom that the Clinton campaign had the better turnout machine. Of course, Clintonâs turnout operation may well have nudged many reluctant voters to the polls, but either way, it wasnât enough. The polling numbers from SurveyMonkey indicate that Clinton was hurt dearly by the voters who decided not to vote. Footnotes The interviews took place on Nov. 9 and Nov. 10. SurveyMonkey also interviewed Americans who were not registered to vote, but Iâm focusing on registered voters here. Weâll have a follow-up on non-registered non-voters. There are, of course, a lot of reasons people donât vote. In addition to not liking their choices, some people donât have the time to vote (they canât get off work, for example). Others are dissuaded or prevented from voting by barriers like voter identification laws."}

Giving evidence today, to a UK parliamentary select committeeÂ thatâs investigating the use of disinformation in political campaigning, Wylie said: âThe 50 million number is what the media has felt safest to report â because of the documentation that they can rely on âÂ but my recollection is that it was substantially higher than that. So my own view is it was much more than 50M.â Weâve reached out to Facebook about Wylieâs claim â but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response. âThere were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,â Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says usersâ data was obtained by CA. âIt first started as a very small pilot â firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral registerâ¦ We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallifeÂ deployed via Facebookâs platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app â that was in late May 2014. âThat project went really well and thatâs when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Koganâs company] in the first week of Juneâ¦ 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.â The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the âfoundational datasetâ underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie. âThis is what built the company,â he claimed. âThis was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.â Facebook has previously confirmedÂ 270,000 people downloaded Koganâs app â a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebookâs APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it. Instead, their friends were âconsentingâ on their behalf â likely also without realizing. Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reportedÂ that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how usersâ data has been so widely misused via his platform. In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak. It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign â and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes.Â EU citizensâ data wouldnât have had any relevance to that. âThere will be two sets of data,â Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. âThe first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.â Facebookâs privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, FacebookÂ settled with theÂ FTC over charges it had deceived usersÂ by âtelling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made publicâ. And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal. Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 â thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election. When CAâs (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data. The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently âdeleted the dataâ. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. âOur algorithms and models bear no trace of it,â it has also tweeted re: the GSR data. Asked by the committee about Nixâs earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent âthe better part of $1M on GSRâ â pointing also to âcopious amounts of emailâ and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and âmatch rates on the dataâ. âThatâs just not true,â he asserted of CAâs claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data. Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. âI knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,â he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered. He also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level â claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, âunderstand the personality of New Yorkersâ. Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the companyâs approach was to target different people for advertising based on their âdispositional attributes and personality traitsâ â traits it tried to identify via patterns it could identify in big data. He said: For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits â so letâs say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism â and when you look at that profiles thatâs the profile of a person whoâs more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, theyâre open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And theyâre anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things â and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various â what everyone now calls fake news â so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They donât see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC.Â And they start to go well why is that everyoneâs talking about this online? Why is it that Iâm seeing everything here but the mainstream media isnât talking about [it]â¦ Not everyoneâs going to adopt that â so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adoptersâ¦ So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like. âThat was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],â he added. âHow far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.â Wylie told the committee that Koganâs company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share â whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later. âThe deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didnât have to go through all the compliance stuff,â added Wylie. âSo we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.â Â âAll kinds of people [had] access to the dataâ Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data â although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms. Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CAâs Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidtâs daughter, during an internship at CA. âWe actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,â claimed Wylie. âAnd some of the documentation that Iâve also provided to the committeeâ¦ [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.â The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions. âThat was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,â he added. âAnd we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didnât officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.â Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely â providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: âPalantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.â The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies â and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns. Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used. âNothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,â he added. âItâs not a legitimate business.â In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CAâs acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: âThe source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the companyâs intellectual property.â Asked whether heâs received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback heâs received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA. âItâs Facebook whoâs most upset about this story,â he told the committee. âTheyâve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They havenât actually taken action on thatâ¦ Theyâve gone silent, they wonât talk to me anymore. âBut I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,â he added. âBut I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].â The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data âsome time in 2015â. During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 â because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his appâs data collection rate had been throttled by the platform for some reason. âHe told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,â said Wylie. âSo Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebookâs engineers â or at least thatâs what he told meâ¦ Facebookâs account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 â and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted? âItâs interesting thatâ¦ the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So Iâm not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of yâknow now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, itâs now working for a presidential campaign.â We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylieâs testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either. Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. âNo they didnât,â he replied. âNot to my knowledge. They certainly didnât with me â until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UKâs Information Commissionerâs Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no Iâve actually given over everything to the authorities.â âI suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016â¦ they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,â he added. âSo I donât think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach thatâs going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.â âAll kinds of people [had] access to the data,â he added. âIt was everywhere.â"}

Calls for investigations came on both sides of the Atlantic after Facebook responded to the explosive reports of misuse of its data by suspending the account of Cambridge Analytica, a British communications firm hired by Trump’s 2016 campaign. “This is a major breach that must be investigated. It’s clear these platforms can’t police themselves,” Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said on Twitter. Expressing “serious concern regarding recent reports that data from millions of Americans was misused in order to influence voters,” Klobuchar and Republican Senator John Kennedy called for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives to appear before Congress, along with the CEOs of Google and Twitter. In Europe, officials voiced similar outrage. Vera Jourova, European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, called the revelations “horrifying, if confirmed,” and vowed to address her concerns while travelling to the United States this week. In Britain, parliamentary committee chair Damian Collins said both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook had questions to answer following what appears to be a giant data breach, carried out in an attempt to influence voters’ choices at the ballot box. “We have repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular whether data had been taken from people without their consent,” Collins said in a statement. “Their answers have consistently understated this risk, and have also been misleading to the committee.” On Wall Street, Facebook shares skidded 7.7 percent in midday trade amid concerns about pressure for new regulations that could hurt its business model. Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research said the revelations highlight “systemic problems at Facebook,” but that they won’t immediately impact Facebook revenues. Still he said “risks are now enhanced” because of the potential for regulations on how Facebook uses data for advertising and monitoring users. According to a joint investigation by The New York Times and Britain’s Observer, Cambridge Analytica was able to create psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users through the use of a personality prediction app that was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up data from friends. Cambridge Analytica said it was in touch with Facebook while denying any misuse of data. Facebook on Friday suspended the firm, but pushed back against the claim of a major breach, suggesting misused data was limited to a far smaller group of users. Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media, said the disclosures will increase pressure to regulate Facebook and other social media firms. “Self-regulation is not working,” Grygiel said. “I’m wondering how bad this needs to get before our regulators step in and hold these companies accountable.” Grygiel said the breach stems from “thin” regulations that allowed Facebook and its partners to exploit data without oversight. “They grew because of this,” she said. “This was not a mistake.” Daniel Kreiss, a professor of media and communications at the University of North Carolina, said Facebook failed to live up to its responsibilities in handling targeted political ads as it expanded. “The fact that Facebook seems to make no distinction between selling sneakers and selling a presidential platform is a deep problem,” Kreiss said. Some analysts suggested the breach posed an existential crisis for Facebook because of how it gathers and uses data on its two billion members. David Carroll, a media professor at the New School’s Parsons School of Design, said Facebook and others will soon be forced to live with new privacy rules such as those set to take effect in the European Union. “Facebook and Google will have to ask users a lot more permission to track them,” Carroll said. “Most people are going to say no, so I think it’s going to have a huge impact on these companies.” Carroll has filed a legal action in Britain calling on Cambridge Analytica to disclose what data was gathered and used on him. “If I can get them to disclose my data or my personality score, it indicates every other American has the right to the same thing,” he said."}

Facebook's stock, which already took a big hit last week, plunged as a result. Tom Pahl, acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the probe would include whether the company engaged in \"unfair acts\" that cause \"substantial injury\" to consumers. Facebook's privacy practices have come under fire after revelations that Cambridge Analytica got data on Facebook users, including information on friends of people who had downloaded a psychological quiz app, even though those friends hadn't given explicit consent to sharing. Facebook is also facing questions over reports that it collected had years of contact names, telephone numbers, call lengths and information about text messages from Android users. Facebook said in a statement on Monday that the company remains \"strongly committed\" to protecting people's information and that it welcomes the opportunity to answer the FTC's questions. News outlets reported on the FTC investigation last week, but the FTC hadn't confirmed it until Monday. Facebook reached a settlement with the FTC in 2011 offering privacy assurances. Facebook said Sunday that this information is uploaded to secure servers and comes only from people who gave explicit consent to allow it. Officials say the data is not sold or shared with users' friends or outside apps. They say the data is used \"to improve people's experience across Facebook\" by helping to connect with others. But the company did not spell out exactly what it used the data for or why it needed it. Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, believes Facebook was in violation of the 2011 settlement in letting Cambridge Analytica harvest data on friends of Facebook users. \"This is what Facebook was doing 10 years ago that people objected to, what the FTC should have stopped in 2011,\" Rotenberg said. \"It makes zero sense that when a person downloads their apps, they have the ability to transfer the data of their friends.\" Although Zuckerberg talked about changes in 2014 that would have prevented this, Rotenberg said it should have been banned already under the 2011 consent decree. He said the FTC had dropped the ball in failing to enforce that."}

The European Commission wants clarification on this within two weeks. To this end, she sent a letter to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer. According to Reuters, which reports that the letter has been read, Jourova also wants to know how Facebook will inform the authorities and the affected citizens if data from EU citizens was part of the scandal . A spokesman for Facebook said that the company continues to make a strong commitment to ensuring people’s privacy and that the questions will be answered. In the letter Jourova would have said that confidence in Facebook has decreased and that statements from managers of Facebook have not taken away her worries. The Commissioner also wants to know whether the social media platform is certain that a similar situation can no longer occur and whether stricter rules are needed. On Monday it appeared that the US Federal Trade Commission is going to investigate Facebook’s actions in protecting privacy. Last week, the European Parliament announced a similar investigation. The investigations follow the scandal surrounding Cambridge Analytics, an American company that acquired the data of fifty million Facebook users. This was done by buying the data from the developer of a Facebook app that had been consulted by several hundred thousand users."}

A Facebook spokesperson told Yahoo Finance it will not. Permanence may have once been a nice feature on Facebook. But the fact that old direct messages, searches, and dossiers of advertising data from years ago is kept has turned into somewhat of a bug for some users, who may not want their old posts and messages to be seen anymore â or even exist. FILE PHOTO: A figurine is seen in front of the Facebook logo in this illustration taken, March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Facebook has understood the importance of this for years, and has allowed users to limit older content. Besides the ability to adjust privacy settings, Facebook has had a âlimit old postsâ button for years that suppresses this old content, cleansing an account of the callow youth that could potentially be embarrassing. But if this refresh on security and privacy settings were to be truly successful, Facebook would likely have to permit its users to have an option in between staying on and letting the data exist and going with the scorched-earth solution of a full deletion, with its data wipe that comes a few months after an account is terminated. (De-activation does not do this.) In lieu of this more drastic measure, Facebook has redesigned its settings menus on mobile, moving over a dozen pages to one single page. This undated product image provided by Facebook shows a redesign of Facebookâs privacy tools. Facebook announced the redesign on Wednesday, March 28, 2018. The changes wonât affect Facebookâs privacy policies or the types of data it gathers on users. But the company hopes its 2.2 billion users will have an easier time navigating its complex and often confusing privacy and security settings. (Facebook via AP) The company also added a new privacy shortcuts menu, where someone can add layers of protection like two-factor authentication â you should do this, since itâs easy to export a personâs data if you had the password â the ability to review and control what youâve shared, and have a say over the ads you see. As to exactly when these changes will occur, a Facebook spokesperson did not specify anything more than that theyâd be ârolling out in the coming weeks.â Until this tool is released, the only way to control activity is through the âactivity log,â another Facebook spokesperson told Yahoo Finance. Facebook will also be updating its terms of service and privacy policy, though not to add new uses for peopleâs data but rather to clarify and make transparent the current policies."}

Though Professor Burns said she was not convinced that Facebook is listening in on conversations â it may have been that she was searching for the same things that she chose to discuss around the phone â but she said that it wouldn't be a surprising move from the site. The claim chimes with anecdotal reports online that the site appears to show ads for things that people have mentioned in passing. Facebook said that it does listen to audio and collect information from users â but that the two aren't combined, and that sounds heard around people aren't used to decide what appears in the app. âFacebook does not use microphone audio to inform advertising or News Feed stories in any way,\" a spokesperson told The Independent. \"Businesses are able to serve relevant ads based on peopleâs interests and other demographic information, but not through audio collection.â At the moment, the feature is only available in the US. When it was first introduced, in 2014, Facebook responded to controversy by arguing that the phone isnât âalways listeningâ and that it never stores the âraw audioâ when it is listening. The next stage for Facebook? Facebook says explicitly on its help pages that it doesnât record conversations, but that it does use the audio to identify what is happening around the phone. The site promotes the feature as an easy way of identifying what you are listening to or watching, to make it easier and quicker to post about whateverâs going on. If people want to use the feature that way, then they can start writing a post in the normal way. If itâs turned on, then it will start identifying what is being listened to or watching â at which point a little face with some soundwaves next to it will appear. If it identifies the sound successfully, then it will show a little â1â next to the face instead â users can then click that, select the thing they are watching or listening to, and then write the rest of the update. âIf your phone's microphone has trouble matching what you're listening to or watching, the room you're in may be loud or a commercial may be on,â according to Facebookâs help page. âIf this happens, tap, drag and release your screen to try a new match.â Turning off the microphone in a phoneâs settings is relatively easy, and since it can be done at the level of the operating system, doing so will mean that Facebook canât turn it on even if it wanted to. Itâs done on an iPhone by heading to the appâs settings, clicking through to privacy and switching the slider for microphone; on Android phones, head to settings and then privacy, and change the permissions that the Facebook app is given."}

First, he weighed in on Amazon's public search for a second headquarters, which has municipalities falling over one another to offer Amazon perks like tax breaks, infrastructure, and even a \"Jeff Bezos Parkway.\" Cook mentioned that Amazon's strategy required a lot of work for the cities pitching the company, even though only one winner will be selected. \"We're not doing the beauty contest,\" Cook said. Then he was asked about Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook has been embroiled in a scandal since it became public earlier this month that the political data firm Cambridge Analytica, which has ties to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, stole data from 50 million users by abusing Facebook's tools. What would Cook do if he were in Zuckerberg's shoes? Well, he wouldn't be, he says. ð¥ð¥ð¥. The full interview with Cook airs a week from Friday at 8 p.m. ET on MSNBC. More context about Cook's quotes is available at Recode."}

One of the largest data leaks in Facebook history allowed Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to Trump campaign strategist Steve Bannon, to develop techniques that formed the basis of its work on the Trump campaign, The New York Times and The Guardian reported. In a blog post, Facebook explained that Cambridge Analytica had years ago received user data from a Facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm was not authorized to have the information. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared personal details with the app. Cambridge Analytica later certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information it had received, according to Facebook, although the social network said it received reports \"several days ago\" that not all the data was deleted. Facebook says it is investigating. Facebook has also suspended the access of Cambridge Analytica's parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories; University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who created the app in question; and another individual, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, who also allegedly received user data from the app. Wylie is a former Cambridge Analytics employee who has emerged as a primary source for the Times report. Cambridge Analytica denied wrongdoing in a statement. It said the parent company's SCL Elections unit hired Kogan to undertake \"a large scale research project in the U.S.,\" but subsequently deleted all data it received from Kogan's company after learning that Kogan had obtained data in violation of Facebook policies. The firm said none of Kogan's data was used in its 2016 election work for the \"avoidance of doubt.\" Kogan did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment. Wylie could not immediately be located. The Facebook blog post, written by deputy general counsel Paul Grewal, cited the \"public prominence\" of Cambridge Analytica, called the alleged data retention an \"unacceptable violation of trust\" and said the social network will take legal action if necessary to hold all parties \"responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\" Cambridge Analytica is probably best known for its political work during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The company claims to build psychological profiles based on personal details from millions of Americans that can categorize individual voters. It worked for both the primary campaign of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Trump's general-election campaign. Trump's campaign Saturday denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data. \"The campaign used the RNC for its voter data and not Cambridge Analytica,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"Using the RNC data was one of the best choices the campaign made. Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false.\" Cambridge Analytica is backed by the family of billionaire donor Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who also supported the Trump campaign and other conservative candidates and causes, including Bannon, the Trump campaign strategist. Trump campaign officials have downplayed Cambridge Analytica's role, saying they briefly used the company for television advertising and paid some of its most skilled data employees. The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Mercer and wooed Bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But Cambridge Analytica did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission. A representative for Bannon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The company has surfaced in the U.S. probes into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. British officials are also investigating the firm in connection with the June 2016 EU referendum. Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, disclosed an advisory role with Cambridge Analytica last August. SCL later said that position never materialized. Flynn is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference after pleading guilty to a felony charge. Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix also disclosed last November that the company reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the campaign to request emails related to the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nix said Assange denied the request, which came after Assange had said publicly that he had the emails. Clinton campaign emails stolen by Russian agents are one focus of the election-interference probes. Nix has denied any involvement in Russian election meddling. Revelations that Cambridge Analytica misused social media data could also be of interest to Mueller's investigation. While much of the thrust of special counsel's investigation has been tightly held, Mueller has requested that the firm turn over the emails of any employees who worked on the campaign, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal last year. Mueller is also looking at the role Wikileaks played in acquiring and making public the stolen Clinton campaign emails."}

However, whether or not the allegations are true (the company has denied them), the singular focus on Cambridge Analytica makes for a simple meme-worthy media narrative, but the reality is that what the company stands accused of by Facebook is in fact what academic researchers, commercial enterprises, governments and even the social media companies themselves do every day with the data entrusted to them by a quarter of the earthâs population. Perhaps the most remarkable takeaway from coverage of the 2016 election is just how starkly changed the reaction of the public and media has been to political use of data-driven election targeting since the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns. When the Obama campaign pushed the boundaries of precision voter targeting, pioneering techniques like peering into the privacy of Americanâs living rooms through their DVRs to see what each individual voter was actually watching on their televisions, the press and public cheered, hailing it as a long overdue modernization of the campaigning process and holding up the campaignâs data scientists as miniature heroes showcasing what could be done with data today. In the leadup to the 2016 election, the press and public derided the Trump campaign as apparently being data-devoid, while hailing Clintonâs campaign as picking up the data-first mantle from the Obama campaign and pushing it even further. In short, data was good and pushing the privacy and ethical boundaries of data to monitor and manipulate voters was a positive, modernizing campaigning in line with the commercial advertising world. Even 1984-ish techniques like mining private DVR viewing habits were lauded as brilliant innovations to advance democracy, not frightening autocratic steps towards a surveillance state. A year later in the midst of a stunning election upset and investigations of Russian influence, the tenor towards data-driven politicking has turned upside down, with a public outcry over the perceived power of data-driven campaigning to allegedly overwhelm organic public will. Though, before attributing absolute campaigning power to data, it is important to remember that Cruzâs failed presidential bid relied on the same firm and data that is credited with Trumpâs win, calling into question the level of impact it actually had. A central theme of the rhetoric and coverage of Cambridge Analytica is that it somehow violated accepted societal norms over the use of Facebook data, with politicians, regulators and major news outlets referring to it in the cybersecurity parlance of a data âbreach.â In fact, this could not be further from the truth in our modern âsurveillance economy.â Facebook and other social media data has, almost from its inception, been a major data source for academic research, with little to no ethical concern for its utilization. Perhaps most famously, in 2008 Harvard and UCLA researchers released a massive dataset compiled from the Facebook accounts of an entire cohort of college students, with the full ethical and legal approval of Facebook and Harvard, full approval of Harvardâs IRB and funding from the National Science Foundation. When asked in 2016 whether its views had evolved since the 2008 release, the university never responded, despite multiple requests to different offices. In 2014 academic researchers at Cornell and Facebook published research in which they had manipulated the emotions of three quarters of a million users and which was published in one of the top scientific journals, PNAS. As with the Harvard study, the research had been fully approved by Facebook and Cornell, with ethical review by Cornellâs IRB. Like the Harvard study 6 years before, the 2014 emotions study generated an immense public, press and academic backlash, with Facebook stating it had redesigned its ethical review process and the journal issuing a statement of editorial concern. Yet, when I followed up in 2016 about how views had changed towards that kind of research at Facebook, Cornell and PNAS, Facebook declined to release any substantive information about its ethics panel beyond a brief overview nor would it release the protocols it uses to review research or the guidelines it requires its researchers to adhere to. As I noted at the time, âIn short, Facebook would not share any details beyond its previous 2014 statement on what changes it has actually made internally, while Cornell and PNAS both noted that they have made only minimal changes. Combined with Harvardâs failure to respond to multiple requests for comment, this suggests that even in the highest-profile cases involving the nationâs top universities with strong Common Rule-compliant IRB systems and at the most prestigious journals in academia, there are few actual changes made in the aftermath of an ethical firestorm. Put another way, in spite of the outpouring of public criticism and claims that new ethical standards are needed, little actual change ever happens and after a brief period of conversation and consternation, things go back to the way they were.â Indeed, three years later it appears little did change at Facebook, with the companyâs internal researchers becoming embroiled in yet another ethical firestorm regarding psychological profiling when it emerged that they had been conducting secret research on more than 6.4 million Australian youth as young as 14 years old to determine when they were at their most vulnerable, experiencing feelings of being âworthlessâ or a âfailureâ in order to better target them for advertisers. When details of the secret research leaked to the press, the companyâs response was that it had not followed its ethical review process, but that the failure to adhere to its ethical review process was merely a minor âoversight.â As I noted at the time, âthe company emphasized that it has a strong ethical review process that determines what constitutes allowable research and must issue approval for any internal company research of sensitive nature conducted on its users and that in this case two employees went ahead and used their privileged access to search for the most vulnerable emotional moments of young children without ever submitting their research for review, and the companyâs response is that this is not a major breach of research protocol that requires an immediate suspension and review of sensitive research across the company, but rather just a minor 'oversight' not to be worried about.â More remarkably, that two Facebook researchers could conduct research on such an extraordinarily sensitive topic on such a vulnerable population and tout that research to advertisers without ever having their work ethically reviewed and, according to the company, without its formal knowledge and approval, suggests Facebook has woefully inadequate central controls over the use of its usersâ data by its own researchers. Indeed, its reaction to the unauthorized research, labeling it as a minor âoversightâ and especially its refusal to comment on whether it had identified other unauthorized research and whether it would be tightening its data access controls, as troubling at best. In this light, Cambridge Analyticaâs alleged use of Facebook data for voter targeting pales in comparison with the ways in which Facebook itself exploits its private user data for its own purposes and those of the researchers that collaborate with it. It is also not the first time that the company has found itself under scrutiny for commercial targeting based on its data. In 2016 Facebook and Twitter terminated social media monitoring company Geofeediaâs access to its data streams after the ACLU published a report documenting how it was being used to surveil lawful protest activity in the United States. Facebook predictably denied knowledge of how Geofeedia was using its data, yet when the ACLU discovered an email referencing a confidential agreement between Geofeedia and Facebook to provide the company with additional Facebook data, Facebook declined to comment further. As I noted at the time, âit is difficult to imagine that neither Facebook nor Twitter had any idea of any kind that one of their licensees was using their data to provide surveillance capabilities to law enforcement. Geofeedia is far from a James Bond cloak-and-dagger defense contractor operating in the shadows â it is a widely known commercial company widely and openly touting its capabilities through numerous case studies and receiving considerable media coverage that specifically discussed its law enforcement clients, while the FBI openly issued an RFP for its services as part of its larger interest in social monitoring. In short, even the most basic of web searches easily turned up that law enforcement was a client of GeoFeediaâs and this thus raises the question of how Twitter and Facebook never noticed that a high-profile subscriber of their services, especially one that allegedly was signing additional special licensing agreements with Facebook, would never have appeared on their radars.â Of course, academia has been a massive consumer of social media data as well, employing its wealth of data for all sorts of extraordinarily sensitive and ethically questionable research. Just six months ago two Stanford University researchers set off an avalanche of ethical concern with a paper that used an AI model to estimate a personâs sexual orientation based purely on a photograph of their face, raising concerns of imprisonment and even execution for LGBT individuals living in repressive countries. The paper was published in an APA journal and reviewed full ethical approval from their IRB, reinforcing the common theme of top journals and institutions as freely accepting sensitive research on social data. Demonstrating the stark divide between the written ethical policies of academia and what actually happens in practice with social data research, Stanford had previously provided comment to me documenting what was one of the most rigorous ethical review processes at an American university, including specialized privacy reviews and typically requiring a signed legal agreement with data vendors, along with noting explicitly that bulk downloading data from a website in violation of its terms of service was absolutely prohibited. Yet, when asked for comment on why those policies did not appear to have been enforced for this study, the university declined to offer comment, saying that it was not permitted to do so. Much as Cambridge Analytica used data gathered from a Facebook personality quiz, the Stanford research also incorporated data from Facebook, gathered through a personality quiz called myPersonality, described as âa popular Facebook application that allowed users to take real psychometric tests, and allowed us to record (with consent!) their psychological and Facebook profiles. Currently, our database contains more than 6,000,000 test results, together with more than 4,000,000 individual Facebook profiles.â As of October 2015, more than 7.5 million people had taken the questionnaire and the resulting data had been used by more than 200 researchers, including at least one Facebook data scientist. That Facebook's own researchers have used such external personality quiz datasets is intriguing in light of its concerns with Cambridge Analytica's activities. Despite declining to comment on the questions posed regarding the studyâs ethical considerations, Stanford did provide a brief statement from one of the authors regarding its use of more than 3 million images from Facebook: the images are âsecondary data that we have obtained from myPersonality app. The users gave the app permission to use their data.â In short, the users clicked a button authorizing their data to be used for research, so they knew what they were getting into and that single personality quiz they took between 2007 and 2012 and long forgot about entitles researchers a decade later to continue to use their information for a publication in 2017. One of the authors was also the lead author of a 2013 PNAS study that demonstrated that Facebook data can be used âto automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender.â Not a day goes by that I donât see a request on an academic mailing list from a university researcher looking to extract a large volume of material from Facebook or announcing a new tool to make bulk extraction of user information from the platform easier. Any change the platform makes to restrict bulk access to its data is met with cries of foul. On the sidelines of any academic social sciences conference can be found any number of academics offering to ship bulk extracted Facebook data to fellow researchers. Moreover, even when social media platforms become aware of explicit violations of their terms of service by researchers, it is unclear what consequences, if any, those researchers face. When asked about a study last year that estimated the political leanings of Twitter users in direct violation of the companyâs explicit prohibition on political profiling, a company spokesperson confirmed that the research was a clear violation of its policy, that academic research was not in any way exempt from its policy and that the researchers had not received any authorization or permission from Twitter to conduct their research. Yet, despite confirming that the research was a direct violation of its policy, when asked whether it would take action against the researchers or any other researchers that violated its policies, the company did not respond. For its part, Facebook modified its terms of service in May 2012 to enshrine its right to conduct research on its users, noting that âcompanies that want to improve their services use the information their customers provide, whether or not their privacy policy uses the word 'research' or not.â Yet, when asked whether the company would ever consider offering an option for users to opt-out of having their personal data used by Facebook for research, the company never responded. Putting this all together, casting Cambridge Analytica as a villain gone rogue with âbreachedâ data from Facebook offers a simple cathartic response to a world the press and public are struggling to understand, but it could not be further from the truth. Everything the company stands accused of (which again it strenuously denies) are simply what academics at universities all across the world do every day with the full knowledge and approval of their ethical oversight boards. Granting agencies like NSF routinely fund the research, IRBs approve it without question (typically treating it as âexemptâ) and the top journals publish it. Indeed, Facebook itself has its own active research program, which as the Australian press leak demonstrates, is conducted under strict secrecy and according to the company itself, may occur without its knowledge or approval. Even when violations are brought to their attention, the companies will at best merely confirm the violations, either dismissing them as minor âoversightsâ or in the case of external researchers, apparently taking no action at all. It is little wonder then that social media data has found such a place in modern research and may have played such a pivotal role in the 2016 election, or as the Cruz campaign discovered, perhaps no role at all. All in all, it is remarkable how in the space of just 8 years data has gone from hero to villain in the world of campaigning, raising questions of whether this will be a tipping point against social media or just another brief bump in the road to quickly wash away. In the end, instead of holding Cambridge Analytica up as a villain, if society at large has concerns about how their Facebook social media personas can be used to monitor and potentially manipulate them, they should take a closer look at the platform that makes it all possible: Facebook. Based in Washington, DC, I founded my first internet startup the year after the Mosaic web browser debuted, while still in eighth grade, and have spent the last 20 years working to reimagine how we use data to understand the world around us at scales and in ways never before..."}

We expect Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and all the organisations involved to cooperate fully.â It comes a day after Damian Collins, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, accused Cambridge Analyticaâs chief executive of making âfalse statementsâ to MPs. Alexander Nix âdeliberately misled the committee and Parliamentâ by denying his company had received data from the Global Science Research (GSR) company, Mr Collins said in a statement, referencing reports in The Observer that tens of millions of Facebook usersâ data had been captured by GSR in a deal with Cambridge Analytica. But Cambridge Analytica denied Mr Nixâs testimony was misleading, saying it âstrongly refutes that reporting because it is wrongâ. A spokesperson told The Independent: âAlexander Nix did not mislead the committee. He told the committee that Cambridge Analytica had received data from GSR in relation to a research project that they undertook on our behalf in 2014. âHe went on to say that Cambridge Analytica does not hold or use any data received from GSR. This is because Cambridge Analytica, in cooperation with Facebook, deleted all data and derivatives received from GSR after it came to light that GSR, as data controller, had contravened its contract with Cambridge Analytica and Facebookâs terms of service. âNone of this data was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.â The company was âvery happyâ to answer further questions from Mr Collins and the committee, it added. Its statement appeared to contradict the official transcript of the 27 February oral evidence session on whether it had received data from GSR, however. Mr Nixâs exchange with Mr Collins on that topic is recorded as: Chair: Does any of your data comes from Global Science Research company? Alexander Nix: GSR? Chair: Yes. Alexander Nix: We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no. Chair: They have not supplied you with data or information? Alexander Nix: No. Chair: Your datasets are not based with information you have received from them? Alexander Nix: No. Chair: At all? Alexander Nix: At all. The Independent has asked Cambridge Analytica for further comment. On Sunday Mr Collins also pointed the finger at Facebook, saying: âData has been taken from Facebook users without their consent, and was then processed by a third party and used to support their campaigns. âFacebook knew about this, and the involvement of Cambridge Analytica with it, and deliberately avoided answering straight questions from the Committee about it.â Mark Zuckerberg should personally answer MPsâ questions, he said. The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal."}

The impending exit of that executive â Alex Stamos, Facebookâs chief information security officer â reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network. Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter. Mr. Stamos, who plans to leave Facebook by August, had advocated more disclosure around Russian interference of the platform and some restructuring to better address the issues, but was met with resistance by colleagues, said the current and former employees. In December, Mr. Stamosâs day-to-day responsibilities were reassigned to others, they said. Mr. Stamos said he would leave Facebook but was persuaded to stay through August to oversee the transition of his responsibilities and because executives thought his departure would look bad, the people said. He has been overseeing the transfer of his security team to Facebookâs product and infrastructure divisions. His group, which once had 120 people, now has three, the current and former employees said. Mr. Stamos would be the first high-ranking employee to leave Facebook since controversy over disinformation on its site. Company leaders â including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebookâs chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer â have struggled to address a growing set of problems, including Russian interference on the platform, the rise of false news and the disclosure over the weekend that 50 million of its user profiles had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company. The developments have taken a toll internally, said the seven people briefed on the matter, who asked not to be identified because the proceedings were confidential. Some of the companyâs executives are weighing their own legacies and reputations as Facebookâs image has taken a beating. Several believe the company would have been better off saying little about Russian interference and note that other companies, such as Twitter, which have stayed relatively quiet on the issue, have not had to deal with as much criticism. One central tension at Facebook has been that of the legal and policy teams versus the security team. The security team generally pushed for more disclosure about how nation states had misused the site, but the legal and policy teams have prioritized business imperatives, said the people briefed on the matter. âThe people whose job is to protect the user always are fighting an uphill battle against the people whose job is to make money for the company,â said Sandy Parakilas, who worked at Facebook enforcing privacy and other rules until 2012 and now advises a nonprofit organization called the Center for Humane Technology, which is looking at the effect of technology on people. Mr. Stamos said in statement on Monday, âThese are really challenging issues, and Iâve had some disagreements with all of my colleagues, including other executives.â On Twitter, he said he was âstill fully engaged with my work at Facebookâ and acknowledged that his role has changed, without addressing his future plans. Facebook did not have a comment on the broader issues around Mr. Stamosâs departure. Mr. Stamos joined Facebook from Yahoo in June 2015. He and other Facebook executives, such as Ms. Sandberg, disagreed early on over how proactive the social network should be in policing its own platform, said the people briefed on the matter. In his statement, Mr. Stamos said his relationship with Ms. Sandberg was âproductive.â Mr. Stamos first put together a group of engineers to scour Facebook for Russian activity in June 2016, the month the Democratic National Committee announced it had been attacked by Russian hackers, the current and former employees said. By November 2016, the team had uncovered evidence that Russian operatives had aggressively pushed DNC leaks and propaganda on Facebook. That same month, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly dismissed the notion that fake news influenced the 2016 election, calling it a âpretty crazy idea.â In the ensuing months, Facebookâs security team found more Russian disinformation and propaganda on its site, according to the current and former employees. By the spring of 2017, deciding how much Russian interference to disclose publicly became a major source of contention within the company. Mr. Stamos pushed to disclose as much as possible, while others including Elliot Schrage, Facebookâs vice president of communications and policy, recommended not naming Russia without more ironclad evidence, said the current and former employees. A detailed memorandum Mr. Stamos wrote in early 2017 describing Russian interference was scrubbed for mentions of Russia and winnowed into a blog post last April that outlined, in hypothetical terms, how Facebook could be manipulated by a foreign adversary, they said. Russia was only referenced in a vague footnote. That footnote acknowledged that Facebookâs findings did not contradict a declassified January 2017 report in which the director of national intelligence concluded Russia had sought to undermine United States election, and Hillary Clinton in particular. Mr. Stamos said in his statement that âwe decided that the responsible thing to do would be to make clear that our findings were consistent with those released by the U.S. intelligence community, which clearly connected the activity in their report to Russian state-sponsored actors.â But Facebookâs decision to omit Russia backfired. Weeks later, a Time magazine article revealed that Russia had created fake accounts and purchased fake ads to spread propaganda on the platform, allegations that Facebook initially denied. By last September, after Mr. Stamosâs investigation had revealed further Russian interference, Facebook was forced to reverse course. That month, the company disclosed that beginning in June 2015, Russians had paid Facebook $100,000 to run roughly 3,000 divisive ads to show the American electorate. In response, lawmakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said that although Facebookâs revelation was a good first step, âIâm disappointed itâs taken 10 months of raising this issue before theyâve become much more transparent.â And the revelation also prompted more attention into how Russians had manipulated the social network. Last October and November, Facebook was grilled in front of lawmakers on Capitol Hill for Russian meddling on its platform, along with executives from Twitter and YouTube. The public reaction caused some at Facebook to recoil at revealing more, said the current and former employees. Since the 2016 election, Facebook has paid unusual attention to the reputations of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, conducting polls to track how they are viewed by the public, said Tavis McGinn, who was recruited to the company last April and headed the executive reputation efforts through September 2017. Mr. McGinn, who now heads Honest Data, which has done polling about Facebookâs reputation in different countries, said Facebook is âcaught in a Catch-22.â âFacebook cares so much about its image that the executives donât want to come out and tell the whole truth when things go wrong,â he said. âBut if they donât, it damages their image.â Mr. McGinn said he left Facebook after becoming disillusioned with the companyâs conduct. By December 2017, Mr. Stamos, who reports to Facebookâs general counsel, proposed that he report directly to higher-ups. Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamosâs team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees. Apart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebookâs security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebookâs representative at the Munich Security Conference. Over the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebookâs communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamosâs tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident. After the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them. Roger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content. âI told them, âYour business is based on trust, and youâre losing trust,ââ said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. âThey were treating it as a P.R. problem, when itâs a business problem. I couldnât believe these guys I once knew so well had gotten so far off track.â"}

According to the New York Times and Britain’s Observer, the company stole information from 50 million Facebook users’ profiles in the tech giant’s biggest-ever data breach, to help them design software to predict and influence voters’ choices at the ballot box. Also suspended were the accounts of its parent organisation, Strategic Communication Laboratories, as well as those of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Kogan. Cambridge Analytica was bankrolled to the tune of US$15 million by US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, a major Republican donor. The Observer said it was headed at the time by Steve Bannon, a top Trump adviser until he was fired last summer. “In 2015, we learned that … Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe,” Facebook said in a posting late on Friday by its vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal. Kogan also improperly shared the data with Wylie, it said. Advertisement Advertisement Kogan’s app, thisisyourdigitallife, offered a personality prediction test, describing itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Some 270,000 people downloaded the app, allowing Kogan to access information such as the city listed on their profile, or content they had “liked.” “However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong,” the Observer reported. Facebook later pushed back against the claim of a data breach, issuing a fresh statement on Saturday that suggested the misused data was limited to those who voluntarily took the test. “People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,” Grewal said. Cambridge Analytica meanwhile said it was in touch with Facebook “in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible .” It blamed the misuse of data on Kogan and said it has since deleted all the data it received from a company he founded, Global Science Research (GSR). “No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign,” it said. ‘TARGETING THEIR INNER DEMONS’ But Wylie, who later became a whistleblower, told the Observer: “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.” Kogan legitimately obtained the information but “violated platform policies” by passing information to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, according to Facebook. Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 when it learned of the violation, and was told by Kogan and everyone who received the data that it had since been destroyed. “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,” Grewal wrote. “We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. “We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.” BRITISH INVESTIGATION Cambridge Analytica, the US unit of British behavioral marketing firm SCL, rose to prominence as the firm that the pro-Brexit group Leave.EU hired for data-gathering and audience-targeting. The company is facing an investigation by Britain’s parliament and regulators over its handling of information. On Saturday, Britain’s information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: “We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.” The New York Times meanwhile reported that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica were still online and that its team had viewed some of the raw data."}

Los Angeles: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly deployed \"secret police\" led by Indian-American Sonya Ahuja to catch and punish those leaking information about the social media giant in press, a media report has said. Zuckerberg hosts weekly meetings where he shares details of unreleased new products and strategies in front of thousands of employees, The Guardian reported. During one of his weekly meetings in 2015, the usually affable CEO warned employees: \"We're going to find the leaker, and we're going to fire them\". A week later, Zuckerberg revealed the culprit had been caught and fired. The media report, citing an unnamed former employee at Facebook, said that he was called into a meeting last year under the guise of a promotion where the investigative team interrogated him. The interrogation by the \"rat-catching\" team, led by the company's head of investigations Ahuja, was a technicality; they already knew he was guilty of leaking some innocuous information to the press, the report said. They had records of a screenshot he'd taken, links he had clicked or hovered over, and they strongly indicated they had accessed chats between him and the journalist, dating back to before he joined the company, it said. \"It's horrifying how much they know. You go into Facebook and it has this warm, fuzzy feeling of 'we're changing the world' and 'we care about things'. But you get on their bad side and all of a sudden you are face to face with Mark Zuckerberg's secret police,\" he told The Guardian. When asked about the report, a Facebook spokeswoman Bertie Thomson said: \"Companies routinely use business records in workplace investigations, and we are no exception\"."}

A whistleblower has revealed to the Observer how Cambridge Analytica â a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trumpâs key adviser Steve Bannon â used personal information taken without authorisation in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements. Christopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: âWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of peopleâs profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.â Documents seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals. Profile Cambridge Analytica: the key players Alexander Nix, CEO An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the companyâs elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer. Aleksandr Kogan, data miner Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CAâs data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan. Steve Bannon, former board member A former investment banker turned âalt-rightâ media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trumpâs campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the âpopulist, economic nationalistâ agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out. Robert Mercer, investor Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax. Rebekah Mercer, investor Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her fatherâs billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercerâs three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative megaâdonors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trumpâs presidential campaign. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The New York Timesis reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data. The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands ofusers were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use. However, the app also collected the information of the test-takersâ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebookâs âplatform policyâ allowed only collection of friendsâ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebookâs role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate âinformation warfareâ against the US. Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissionerâs Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum. âWe are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,â said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. âItâs part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing peopleâs personal information to micro-target voters.â On Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebookâs external lawyers warned the Observer it was making âfalse and defamatoryâ allegations, and reserved Facebookâs legal position. The revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. âResidents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,â she said on Twitter. The Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. âThis story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether itâs allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, itâs clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,â he said. Last month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data. Simon Milner, Facebookâs UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: âThey may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.â Cambridge Analyticaâs chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: âWe do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.â Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agencyâs cybercrime unit and the Information Commissionerâs Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles â mostly belonging to registered US voters â were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower. At the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014. The evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebookâs own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles. That legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him. âBecause this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,â the letter said. Facebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said. âThat to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.â Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: âFacebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and itâs failed in its duties to respect the law. âIt has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasnât. Itâs failed time and time again to be open and transparent.â We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons Christopher Wylie A majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan âgained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channelsâ but âdid not subsequently abide by our rulesâ because he passed the information on to third parties. Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. âWe are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,â Paul Grewal, Facebookâs vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted. Kogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the companyâs terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a âclose working relationshipâ with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps. Quick guide How the story unfolded In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name. Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic âwarâ on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit. She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britainâs Electoral Commission and the Information Commissionerâs Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analyticaâs use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics. While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players. The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a âtextbook example of bad journalismâ. But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience. Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates. Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Muellerâs probing of the companyâs role in Donald Trumpâs presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour. The algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate. âThe ultimate product of the training set is creating a âgold standardâ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,â the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million âmatchedâ profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further. At the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firmâs data had come from GSR, Nix said: âWe had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.â Cambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not. GSR was âled by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Electionsâ, a company spokesman said. SCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been âknowingly breachedâ and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election. Steve Bannonâs lawyer said he had no comment because his client âknows nothing about the claims being assertedâ. He added: âThe first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.â He directed inquires to Nix.

A State Department official said Monday the agency’s Global Engagement Center has a contract with Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) Group, the parent company of under-fire Cambridge Analytica. The agency has no business with CA, but SCL is closely tied to its offshoot and Facebook announced last week that it was suspending both, under the title “SCL/Cambridge Analytica,” from its platform. A public record of the contract on a U.S. government site, spotted by the Defense One news website, lists its value as $496,232 and states it was awarded to the “SCL Group Ltd. of London” on Feb. 17, 2017. The State Department official said the contract was to provide “research and analytical support in connection with our mission to counter terrorist propaganda and disinformation overseas. “SCL, in particular SCL Defence, has done work for other parts of the U.S. government in the past and is a major company in the field of research and analytics,” she said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Global Engagement Center was set up under former U.S. President Barack Obama to analyze and push back against online propaganda and recruitment by armed extremist groups such as the Islamic State. Since Donald Trump came into office, Congress has assigned $120 million to the center to counter the kind of state propaganda U.S. intelligence says Russia deployed to influence the 2016 presidential election. But former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was sacked last week, never accepted the funding and the GEC had continued to focus on online jihadi influence rather than state actors like China and Russia. Analyzing the online profile of suspected jihadis and sympathizers and then “micro-targeting” them for counterpropaganda would be exactly the kind of work that the data-mining firm SCL was set up to do. But the Cambridge Analytica unit, launched in 2013 to offer advanced assistance to election campaign operations, has been accused of using underhand techniques to influence voters in democratic polls. Facebook has suspended the firm’s account for allegedly covertly creating behavioral profiles of 50 million potential U.S. voters as part of its paid support for Trump’s 2016 campaign. Cambridge Analytica denies the claim, but it is also facing a probe from British regulators seeking a court order to seize its servers and investigate allegations of breach of privacy during voter research. And more pressure was piled on the firm when Britain’s Channel 4 showed footage of CA executives boasting to an undercover reporter about alleged election influence techniques. The pair told the reporter, masquerading as a Sri Lankan businessman keen to influence a vote in his home country, that they had secretly worked in African and European countries as well as in the U.S. They described the practice of subcontracting dirty tricks work to former British and Israeli intelligence agents and using Ukrainian women to lure unsuspecting candidates into compromising situations. The firm accused Channel 4 of misrepresentation and said the executives had tried to assess the bona fides of a potential client by testing whether he would ask for unethical services they would never provide."}

The employee, who did not wish to be named, did an interview with The Guardian Friday and said he was called to a meeting last year under the guise of a promotion. When he arrived at the meeting, he found himself in front of Facebook's investigative team and they presented proof he'd leaked information to the press. \"It's horrifying how much they know,\" he said. \"You go into Facebook and it has this warm, fuzzy feeling of 'we're changing the world' and 'we care about things'. But you get on their bad side and all of a sudden you are face to face with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's secret police.\" The employee explained how an investigative team led by Sonya Ahuja had records of screenshots, links he visited, and even links he had only hovered over. The also presented records of chats the employee had with a journalist where they allegedly discussed information he was not authorized to expose. \"When you first get to Facebook you are shocked at the level of transparency. You are trusted with a lot of stuff you don't need access to,\" the employee explained. \"The counterbalance to giving you this huge trusting environment is if anyone steps out of line, they'll squash you like a bug.\" When The Guardian queried Facebook regarding the accusations of the use of secret police, the company responded, \"Companies routinely use business records in workplace investigations, and we are no exception.\""}

Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images For the past four days, Facebook has been taken to the woodshed by critics, the stock market, and regulators after it was reported that the data-science firm Cambridge Analytica obtained the data of 50 million Facebook users. Until Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg had stayed silent. On Wednesday afternoon, though, he addressed the problem in a personal Facebook post and laid out some of the solutions he will introduce. He then gave an interview to WIRED in which he discussed the recent crisis, the mistakes Facebook made, and different models for how the company could be regulated. He also discussed the possibility that anotherâRussianâshoe could drop. Here is a transcript of that conversation: Nicholas Thompson: You learned about the Cambridge Analytica breach in late 2015, and you got them to sign a legal document saying the Facebook data they had misappropriated had been deleted. But in the two years since, there were all kinds of stories in the press that could have made one doubt and mistrust them. Why didnât you dig deeper to see if they had misused Facebook data? Mark Zuckerberg: So in 2015, when we heard from journalists at The Guardian that Aleksandr Kogan seemed to have shared data with Cambridge Analytica and a few other parties, the immediate actions that we took were to ban Koganâs app and to demand a legal certification from Kogan and all the other folks who he shared it with. We got those certifications, and Cambridge Analytica had actually told us that they actually hadnât received raw Facebook data at all. It was some kind of derivative data, but they had deleted it and werenât [making] any use of it. In retrospect, though, I think that what youâre pointing out here is one of the biggest mistakes that we made. And thatâs why the first action that we now need to go take is to not just rely on certifications that weâve gotten from developers, but [we] actually need to go and do a full investigation of every single app that was operating before we had the more restrictive platform policiesâthat had access to a lot of dataâand for any app that has any suspicious activity, weâre going to go in and do a full forensic audit. And any developer who wonât sign up for that weâre going to kick off the platform. So, yes, I think the short answer to this is that's the step that I think we should have done for Cambridge Analytica, and weâre now going to go do it for every developer who is on the platform who had access to a large amount of data before we locked things down in 2014. NT: OK, great. I did write a piece this week saying I thought that was the main mistake Facebook made. MZ: The good news here is that the big actions that we needed to take to prevent this from happening today we took three or four years ago. But had we taken them five or six years ago, we wouldnât be here right now. So I do think early on on the platform we had this very idealistic vision around how data portability would allow all these different new experiences, and I think the feedback that weâve gotten from our community and from the world is that privacy and having the data locked down is more important to people than maybe making it easier to bring more data and have different kinds of experiences. And I think if weâd internalized that sooner and had made these changes that we made in 2014 in, say, 2012 or 2010 then I also think we could have avoided a lot of harm. NT: And thatâs a super interesting philosophical change, because what interests me the most about this story is that there are hard tradeoffs in everything. The critique of Facebook two weeks ago was that you need to be more open with your data, and now itâs that certain data needs to be closed off. You can encrypt data more, but if you encrypt data more it makes it less useful. So tell me the other philosophical changes that have been going through your mind during the past 72 hours as youâve been digging into this. MZ: Well thatâs the big one, but I think that thatâs been decided pretty clearly at this point. I think the feedback that weâve gotten from peopleânot only in this episode but for yearsâis that people value having less access to their data above having the ability to more easily bring social experiences with their friendsâ data to other places. And I donât know, I mean, part of that might be philosophical, it may just be in practice what developers are able to build over the platform, and the practical value exchange, thatâs certainly been a big one. And I agree. I think at the heart of a lot of these issues we face are tradeoffs between real values that people care about. You know, when you think about issues like fake news or hate speech, right, itâs a tradeoff between free speech and free expression and safety and having an informed community. These are all the challenging situations that I think we are working to try to navigate as best we can. NT: So is it safe to assume that, as you went through the process over the past few days, youâve been talking about the tradeoffs, looking at a wide range of solutions, and you picked four or five of them that are really good, that are solid, that few people are going to dispute? But that thereâs a whole other suite of changes that are more complicated that we may hear about from you in the next few weeks? MZ: There are definitely other things that weâre thinking about that are longer term. But thereâs also a lot of nuance on this, right? So there are probably 15 changes that weâre making to the platform to further restrict data, and I didnât list them all, because a lot of them are kind of nuanced and hard to explainâso I kind of tried to paint in broad strokes what the issues are, which were first, going forward, making sure developers canât get access to this kind of data. The good news there is that the most important changes there had been made in 2014. But there are still several other things that, upon examination, it made sense to do now. And then the other is just that we want to make sure that there arenât other Cambridge Analyticas out there. And if they were able to skate by giving us, say, fraudulent legal certification, I just think our responsibility to our community is greater than to just rely on that from a bunch of different actors who might have signals, as you say, of doing suspicious things. So I think our responsibility is to now go and look at every single app and to, any time thereâs anything suspicious, get into more detail and do a full audit of them. Those, I think, are the biggest pieces. NT: Got it. Weâre learning a lot every day about Cambridge Analytica, and weâre learning what they did. How confident are you that Facebook data didnât get into the hands of Russian operativesâinto the Internet Research Agency, or even into other groups that we may not have found yet? MZ: I canât really say that. I hope that we will know that more certainly after we do an audit. You know, for what itâs worth on this, the report in 2015 was that Kogan had shared data with Cambridge Analytica and others. When we demanded the certification from Cambridge Analytica, what they came back with was saying: Actually, we never actually received raw Facebook data. We got maybe some personality scores or some derivative data from Kogan, but actually that wasnât useful in any of the models, so weâd already deleted it and weren't using it in anything. So yes, weâll basically confirm that weâll fully expunge it all and be done with this. So Iâm not actually sure where this is going to go. I certainly think the New York Times and Guardian and Channel 4 reports that we received last week suggested that Cambridge Analytica still had access to the data. I mean, those sounded credible enough that we needed to take major action based on it. But, you know, I donât want to jump to conclusions about what is going to be turned up once we complete this audit. And the other thing Iâd say is that we have temporarily paused the audit to cede to the UK regulator, the ICO [Information Commissioner's Office], so that they can do a government investigationâI think it might be a criminal investigation, but itâs a government investigation at a minimum. So weâll let them go first. But we certainly want to make sure that we understand how all this data was used and fully confirm that no Facebook community data is out there. NT: But presumably thereâs a second level of analysis you could do, which would be to look at the known stuff from the Internet Research Agency, to look at data signatures from files you know Kogan had, and to see through your own data, not through the audited data, whether thereâs a potential that that information was passed to the IRA. Is that investigation something thatâs ongoing? MZ: You know, weâve certainly looked into the IRAâs ad spending and use in a lot of detail. The data that Koganâs app got, it wasnât watermarked in any way. And if he passed along data to Cambridge Analytica that was some kind of derivative data based on personality scores or something, we wouldnât have known that, or ever seen that data. So it would be hard to do that analysis. But weâre certainly looking into what the IRA did on an ongoing basis. The more important thing, though, that I think weâre doing there is just trying to make the sure government has all the access to the content that they need. So they've given us certain warrants, weâre cooperating as much as we can with those investigations, and my view, at least, is that the US government and special counsel are going to have a much broader view of all the different signals in the system than weâre going toâincluding, for example, money transfers and things like that that we just wonât have access to be able to understand. So I think that thatâs probably the best bet of coming up with a link like that. And nothing that weâve done internally so far has found a linkâdoesnât mean that there isnât oneâbut we havenât identified any. NT: Speaking of Congress, there are a lot of questions about whether you will go and testify voluntarily, or whether youâll be asked in a more formal sense than a tweet. Are you planning to go? MZ: So, hereâs how we think about this. Facebook regularly testifies before Congress on a number of topics, most of which are not as high profile as the Russia investigation one recently. And our philosophy on this is: Our job is to get the government and Congress as much information as we can about anything that we know so they have a full picture, across companies, across the intelligence community, they can put that together and do what they need to do. So, if it is ever the case that I am the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify, I will happily do that. But the reason why we havenât done that so far is because there are people at the company whose full jobs are to deal with legal compliance or some of these different things, and theyâre just fundamentally more in the details on those things. So as long as itâs a substantive testimony where what folks are trying to get is as much content as possible, Iâm not sure when Iâll be the right person. But I would be happy to if I were. NT: OK. When you think about regulatory models, thereâs a whole spectrum. There are kind of simple, limited things, like the Honest Ads Act, which would be more openness on ads. Thereâs the much more intense German model, or what France has certainly talked about. Or there's the ultimate extreme, like Sri Lanka, which just shut social media down. So when you think about the different models for regulation, how do you think about what would be good for Facebook, for its users, and for civic society? MZ: Well, I mean, I think youâre framing this the right away, because the question isnât âShould there be regulation or shouldnât there be?â Itâs âHow do you do it?â And some of the ones, I think, are more straightforward. So take the Honest Ads Act. Most of the stuff in there, from what Iâve seen, is good. We support it. Weâre building full ad transparency tools; even though it doesnât necessarily seem like that specific bill is going to pass, weâre going to go implement most of it anyway. And thatâs just because I think it will end up being good for our community and good for the internet if internet services live up to a lot of the same standards, and even go further than TV and traditional media have had to in advertisingâthat just seems logical. There are some really nuanced questions, though, about how to regulate which I think are extremely interesting intellectually. So the biggest one that Iâve been thinking about is this question of: To what extent should companies have a responsibility to use AI tools to kind of self-regulate content? Here, let me kind of take a step back on this. When we got started in 2004 in a dorm room, there were two big differences about how we governed content on the service. Basically, back then people shared stuff and then they flagged it and we tried to look at it. But no one was saying, \"Hey, you should be able to proactively know every time someone posts something bad,\" because the AI tech was much less evolved, and we were a couple of people in a dorm room. So I think people understood that we didnât have a full operation that can go deal with this. But now you fast-forward almost 15 years and AI is not solved, but it is improving to the point where we can proactively identify a lot of contentânot all of it, you know; some really nuanced hate speech and bullying, itâs still going to be years before we can get atâbut, you know, nudity, a lot of terrorist content, we can proactively determine a lot of the time. And at the same time weâre a successful enough company that we can employ 15,000 people to work on security and all of the different forms of community [operations]. So I think thereâs this really interesting question of: Now that companies increasingly over the next five to 10 years, as AI tools get better and better, will be able to proactively determine what might be offensive content or violate some rules, what therefore is the responsibility and legal responsibility of companies to do that? That, I think, is probably one of the most interesting intellectual and social debates around how you regulate this. I donât know that itâs going to look like the US model with Honest Ads or any of the specific models that you brought up, but I think that getting that right is going to be one of the key things for the internet and AI going forward. NT: So how does government even get close to getting that right, given that it takes years to make laws and then theyâre in place for more years, and AI will be completely different in two years from what it is now? Do they just set you guidelines? Do they require a certain amount of transparency? What can be done, or what can the government do, to help guide you in this process? MZ: I actually think itâs both of the things that you just said. So I think what tends to work well are transparency, which I think is an area where we need to do a lot better and are working on that and are going to have a number of big announcements this year, over the course of the year, about transparency around content. And I think guidelines are much better than dictating specific processes. So my understanding with food safety is thereâs a certain amount of dust that can get into the chicken as itâs going through the processing, and itâs not a large amountâit needs to be a very small amountâand I think thereâs some understanding that youâre not going to be able to fully solve every single issue if youâre trying to feed hundreds of millions of peopleâor, in our case, build a community of 2 billion peopleâbut that it should be a very high standard, and people should expect that weâre going to do a good job getting the hate speech out. And that, I think, is probably the right way to do itâto give companies the right flexibility in how to execute that. I think when you start getting into micromanagement, of âOh, you need to have this specific queue or this,â which I think what you were saying is the German modelâyou have to handle hate speech in this wayâin some ways thatâs actually backfired. Because now we are handling hate speech in Germany in a specific way, for Germany, and our processes for the rest of the world have far surpassed our ability to handle, to do that. But weâre still doing it in Germany the way that itâs mandated that we do it there. So I think guidelines are probably going to be a lot better. But this, I think, is going to be an interesting conversation to have over the coming years, maybe, more than today. But itâs going to be an interesting question. NT: Last question. Youâve had a lot of big changes: The meaningful interactions was a huge change; the changes in the ways that youâve found and stopped the spread of misinformation; the changes today, in the way you work with developers. Big changes, right. Lots of stuff happening. When you think back at how you set up Facebook, are there things, choices, directional choices, you wish you had done a little differently that would have prevented us from being in this situation? MZ: I donât know; thatâs tough. To some degree, if the communityâif we hadnât served a lot of people, then I think that some of this stuff would be less relevant. But thatâs not a change I would want to go back and reverse. You know, I think the world is changing quickly. And I think social norms are changing quickly, and peopleâs definitions around what is hate speech, what is false newsâwhich is a concept people werenât as focused on before a couple of years agoâpeopleâs trust and fear of governments and different institutions is rapidly evolving, and I think when youâre trying to build services for a community of 2 billion people all over the world, with different social norms, I think itâs pretty unlikely that you can navigate that in a way where youâre not going to face some thorny tradeoffs between values, and need to shift and adjust your systems, and do a better job on a lot of stuff. So I donât begrudge that. I think that we have a serious responsibility. I want to make sure that we take it as seriously as it should be taken. Iâm grateful for the feedback that we get from journalists who criticize us and teach us important things about what we need to do, because we need to get this right. Itâs important. Thereâs no way that sitting in a dorm in 2004 youâre going to solve everything upfront. Itâs an inherently iterative process, so I donât tend to look at these things as: Oh, I wish we had not made that mistake. I mean, of course I wish we didnât make the mistakes, but it wouldnât be possible to avoid the mistakes. Itâs just about, how do you learn from that and improve things and try to serve the community going forward?"}

Should you quit Facebook? Over the weekend, the media reported a whistleblowerâs account of serious misuse of user data. The social network is now under more pressure than everâ¦ âI need to make amends,â said the man with the pink hair. Christopher Wylie, a 27-year-old vegan from Canada, may not seem like the type to mess with Western democracy. But the data expert was key in creating a system that harvested Facebook usersâ data and used it in political campaigns. His regret led him to tell his story to The New York Times and The Observer, whose reports have caused a huge stir. In 2013, he had a big idea. New research was showing that a personâs social media activity could be used to build a detailed profile of their personality. Wylie believed that it could predict their political views too. Armed with such data, a political candidate could, say, target adverts at potential voters. Wylie soon found financial backers: Republicans in the USA. He helped set up a company in the UK, Cambridge Analytica (CA), to execute his vision. The company hired Aleksandr Kogan, a Cambridge academic, to create a Facebook app that asked users to give access to their profile. It also invited them to share data about their friends (without the friendsâ consent). Altogether, the app gathered data on around 50 million Americans. It claimed to need the data for academic purposes. In fact, Kogan sold the information to CA, which went on to help Donald Trumpâs campaign. The sale violated Facebookâs privacy rules. The social media giant learned of this in 2015; according to Wylie, it did not try very hard to set things right. As Wylie puts it, âWe âbrokeâ Facebook.â CAâs and Facebookâs influence on politics is being investigated in both the UK and the US. Wylieâs revelations, backed by hard evidence, contradict statements made by the firms to the inquiries. Both deny any wrongdoing. However, Facebook has suspended CA (and Wylie) from its platform, and says that it is looking into the issue. This apparent breach of data comes at an awkward time for Facebook. The firm was already on the defensive, as critics accused it of spreading fake news and Russian propaganda. Should we just stop using the website? Sell-by data Rubbish, say some. Overall, Facebook is a force for good. Whether you want to raise awareness of an issue thatâs close to your heart or just message a friend, the website is on your side. Letâs take this crisis as an opportunity to read its privacy rules, and make sure weâre using it responsibly. How naive, reply others. Facebookâs privacy policy is designed to confuse you. But Wylieâs story shows that, even if it has the best intentions, the website is sloppy about protecting your data. A significant amount of your personal information is ending up in unauthorised peopleâs hands. The only way to avoid this for sure is to log off for good. You decide Would the world be a poorer place without Facebook? Will social media still exist in 50 years? Activities Make a list of the information that is publicly displayed on your social media. Pair up, and write a âpersonality profileâ of your partner based on their info. Spend a week without going on social media. Keep a journal of your thoughts about the experience. Will you go back to social media in a week? Why (not)? Some people say... âMove fast and break things.â Facebookâs former motto What do you think? Q & A What do we know? Koganâs app paid Facebook users to take a personality test. In return, it got access to âalmost everythingâ on their profiles, says Wylie. This was permitted â but selling the data was not (which is why Facebook is blaming Kogan). On learning of Koganâs deal with CA in 2015, Facebook shut down his app, and asked everyone involved to delete the data. But it has been revealed that this did not happen. What do we not know? Exactly how this data was used, and what effect it had. Former officials on the Trump campaign say that CA helped them design target audiences for digital ads, model voter turnout, and more. However, some say that CA has exaggerated its own influence; others argue that it may not have relied much on the âstolenâ data anyway. Word watch Republicans CA received its funding from Robert Mercer, an American billionaire who initially backed Ted Cruzâs presidential campaign before switching to Trump. The company was co-founded by Steve Bannon, Trumpâs former adviser. Cambridge Analytica The firm also worked with the pro-Brexit campaign in the UK. It is independent of Cambridge University.

Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, had replied earlier that its certain apps made by developers collect data from users if the users consent to it.

I mean, a lot. If you've ever been creeped out by a scarily on-point ad while visiting Facebook, that's why. But some of you might wonder where Facebook gets its data. The answer is simple: data brokers. A data broker collects your information from various sources and depending on the broker in question, this information could come from online, offline, or both. Whenever you make a purchase online or utilize your grocery store's loyalty card, the data on your purchases is collected by at least one company. Facebook buys this data and, letting advertisers use it to more specifically target ads towards you. Though Facebook says that the data brokers anonymize what they collect, the details can still be matched against your Facebook profile, building for Facebook and its advertisers a complete picture of who you are. Creepy, right? There's some good news here, though. You can opt-out of this sort of data collection at a lot of data brokers including the companies with which Facebook has partnered. And you can do this on top of using security features such as limiting ad tracking on devices like your iPhone and iPad. Who has your data Right now, Facebook lists seven companies as \"Audience Data Providers\" on its Marketing Partners Program. These are the companies that currently provide data to Facebook from around the world: Acxiom Epsilon Experian Oracle Data Cloud Quantium KBM Group CCC Marketing The bad news is that these companies are Facebook's partners for now. The social network sometimes rotates between different data providers, meaning that if another company starts providing its data to Facebook, you'll probably want to opt-out of them, as well. How to remove your data from or stop tracking by Facebook's data providers In your quest to wrench your data from the grips of these data brokers, know that it will take awhile. One thing in common with all of these companies is that you'll need to specify exactly what you want to be left out of any data collection, including your name, phone number, and any email addresses. Here's how to suppress your data or prevent tracking at the Facebook data partners that provide such tools. Acxiom In addition to options for opting out of data collection by phone or mail, Acxiom provides an online form that you can fill out in order to prevent your data from being collected. Note that this opt-out form covers only one identity at a time. Click the checkboxes under the type of information that you want to remove (mailing addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses) from Acxiom's data tracking under Acxiom Corporations's Online Opt-Out. Choose who is the subject of this data removal: yourself, someone over whom you have guardianship, or a deceased family member. Click the green + sign on the box that says Full Names. Add your name to the fields presented to you that you want to be removed from Acxiom's data tracking. Click Add to complete adding the name to the opt-out list. Repeat steps 4-6 to add more names to the list, including nicknames, former names, and married names. This list, like the other three, accepts up to 10 entries. Click the green + sign on the box that says Phone numbers. Add a phone number that you want to be removed from tracking. Click Add to add the phone number to your opt-out list. Repeat steps 8-10 to add more numbers to your list. Click the green + sign on the box that says Email Addresses. Add an email address that you want to be removed from tracking. Click Add to add the email address to your opt-out list. Repeat steps 12-14 to add more email addresses to your list Click the green + sign on the box that says Mailing Addresses. Add a mailing address that you want to be removed from tracking. Click Add to add the mailing address to your opt-out list. Repeat steps 15-17 to add more mailing addresses to your list. Click Submit. Enter the email address to which you'd like Acxiom to send your opt-out confirmation. Click Submit. Acxiom will send you an email with a link you need to complete your opt-out request. Click the link in the email from Acxiom. Click Submit on the confirmation page. The data you submitted on Axiom's forms should now be removed from Acxiom's marketing packages. Epsilon Contacting Epsilon to opt-out of its databases is all about direct mail. Epsilon doesn't actually own anything like email data, so all it can do is stop providing your name and mailing address to clients. In order to opt-out of mail from Epsilon clients, you'll need to send an opt-out request to optout@epsilon.com and provide your full name and address for the opt-out procedure. Experian Ugh, Experian. This company offers its databases to clients for several different purposes and, as a result, has seven different products from which you might want your information removed. Some of these can be opted-out of by a link, while others require you to email, mail, or call in your opt-out request. You can opt out of Experian's databases via link for the following services: On each of these pages, there will be a link labeled \"Click here\" that you can click to opt-out of the tracking performed for these services. Unfortunately, all this opt-out process does is embed a cookie in your browser so that Experian's trackers around the web knows not to track you. This means that the opt-out is only for activity performed in your current browser on your current computer. If you want Experian to suppress the information that it has collected on you and continues to collect across its direct mail, telemarketing, and online targeted advertising services, you'll need to send an email containing all of the relevant information that you want suppressed to optout@experian.com. If you're looking to opt out of Experian's email marketing databases, you'll need to send an email from the address you want to opt out to unsubscribeall@experian.com, which will remove you from the company's permission-based email database used by Experian and its partners. Finally, opt out of pre-approved offers like credit cards and insurance mailing lists by calling 1-888-567-8688. Oracle Data Cloud Like Experian, Oracle offers an opt-out cookie for its Internet Based Advertising product. This will prevent Oracle tools from tracking your activity in your current browser on your current machine. Here's how to use it. Fill out the available form with your name, address, and email address. Click Submit. Quantium Quantium, compared to the rest of these companies, makes it fairly easy to opt-out of having your information shared with the company's partners, including Facebook. It provides a number of links that let you opt-out of being targeted by a Quantium partner's advertisers using Quantium-provided data. KBM Group Click the click here button on the line that begins. \"To complete the opt-out process,\". If the opt-out it successful, you'll be taken to a screen that says so. A quick note These are by no means the only data brokers out there. Data collection and brokerage is a massive industry. If you'd like to try and opt out of data collection by more brokers, check out this list of companies, which also features links to their opt-out tools or instructions. Keep in mind that this list is a few years old, so some of its information might be out of date. But it's a good resource for getting started. If all of this seems a bit confusing, that's probably because it's supposed to. These companies really don't want you opting out of their data collection because that's how they make money. The important thing is to keep slogging through it. Something to be aware of as you complete these processes is that your data won't actually be removed from the databases these companies keep. They'll suppress it, and not send it to their marketing partners like Facebook, but they'll hang on to it to make sure that it a piece of your data hits their database again, it stays out of their marketing services. Also yes, it does seem counterintuitive that getting these companies to suppress information they collect about you often involves sending them a lot of information about you. Questions If you have any other questions about stopping data brokers from selling the data that they've collected on you, let us know in the comments."}

Three congressional committees have invited Zuckerberg to testify, including the Senate Judiciary Committee at an April 10 meeting about data privacy. It is unclear how many hearings Zuckerberg will attend, and of which committees. A spokeswoman for the House Energy and Commerce committee, another of the panels that has invited Zuckerberg to a hearing, said the chief executive has not confirmed his attendance. âThe committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify,â said the spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez. Zuckerberg stayed mum for nearly a week after the Cambridge Analytica controversy erupted, frustrating both lawmakers and Facebook employees. In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, he answered the question of whether he would testify by saying that he was âhappy to, if itâs the right thing to do.â He added that he felt it often made more sense to send subject matter experts. âWhat I think we've found so far is that typically there are people whose whole job is focused on an area, but I would imagine at some point that there would be a topic where I am the sole authority on and that would make sense for me to do and I'll be happy to do it at that point.â On Tuesday, Facebook opted not to make Zuckerberg available to testify before a key parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom investigating the same issue, which had asked him to appear. That panelâs leader, Chairman Damian Collins, previously accused Facebook of having âunderstated the riskâ about the data it holds on its users â and whether it had been taken without consent. Instead, Facebook said in a letter to Collins that it would send one of his deputies, Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer and Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, in his place. Cox is now slated to appear at a hearing in the coming weeks. âThe Committee will also request that Mark Zuckerberg clarify whether he is in a position to give evidence,â the panel said. In the United States, three congressional committees have requested that Zuckerberg testify. One of the panels, the Senate Judiciary Committee, also asked the leaders of Google and Twitter to join him at its April hearing. But lawmakers so far have not said if theyâd take the rare step of issuing a subpoena, forcing Zuckerberg to appear. Spokespeople for two of the committees â the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Commerce Committee â did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. Twitter and Google declined to comment. Shares in Facebook, Google and Twitter were trading sharply lower Tuesday. Silicon Valley executives have gone to great lengths to avoid testifying before both public committees and courts. During congressional hearings on Russian meddling last fall, lawmakers also called for the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter to come forward. But the companies sent their lawyers instead. In February, Google suddenly settled a protracted legal dispute with Uber over self-driving cars, the week that co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were expected to testify. Zuckerberg in particular appears to be far more comfortable when he can control his appearance. He once hired a personal pollster to gauge the most minor shifts in the public perception of him. His public statements are almost always only on Facebookâs own platforms; he hasnât used Twitter in years. Even candid photos that appear of him, such as those that took place during his U.S. tour last year, are carefully managed. Zuckerberg would not be the first major tech executive to submit to a congressional grilling in recent years. A lengthy probe of Appleâs tax practices led Senate lawmakers to press CEO Tim Cook at a hearing in 2013. Two years earlier, another panel of senators peppered Googleâs then-executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, about his companyâs size, and whether the search giant leveraged its corporate footprint to the detriment of its rivals. Initially, though, Google sought to spare its top executives from a high-profile Capitol Hill showdown. Instead, it offered to dispatch its chief legal officer, David Drummond, to testify to Congress. That infuriated leaders of the Senateâs top antitrust committee, who said at the time they might take âformalâ action â a subtle threat of a subpoena â that might have forced the search giant to send a more senior executive anyway. In Europe, Facebook could face potentially more serious legal consequences for its mistakes. Under European law, privacy is considered a fundamental human right and companies cannot use personal data without notifying and obtaining permission from consumers. A new data privacy regime going into effect this year fines companies up to four percent of global revenue for each violation. In the U.S., Facebookâs use of peopleâs data is governed in part by a 2011 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. That agreement also requires that Facebook obtain consumersâ consent before making changes to how their data is shared or used. The agency is investigating whether Facebook broke that agreement when Cambridge Analytica took the profiles of individuals and their friends.

{"originalUrl":"https://digiday.com/media/media-companies-shifting-attention-facebook-youtube/","title":"Why media companies are shifting their attention from Facebook to YouTube - Digiday","text":"When House of Highlights decided to expand beyond its popular Instagram account, the Bleacher Report-owned sports and culture publication didnât even consider Facebook. First, Facebook isnât a top destination for House of Highlightsâ main audience of 12- to 24-year-olds, said Doug Bernstein, gm of House of Highlights. Second, the platform wasn’t just looking for scale for scale’s sake. “We want to be deeper with our community,” he said. So House of Highlights turned to YouTube, joining aÂ growingnumberof publishers and even famous athletes that see the Google-owned video service as the preferred platform to reach their core audience and reap some revenue in return. A year ago, NBA star Kevin Durant was looking to reconnect with fans after switching teams. Durant and Rich Kleiman, his manager and co-founder of Thirty Five Media, sidestepped the other big platforms and met with YouTubeâs top brass, including CEO Susan Wojcicki, chief business officer Robert Kyncl and chief product officer Neal Mohan. Kleiman already knew how big an audience YouTube had, but he came away from the meeting understanding how big YouTube stars had become and seeing that other athletes had not taken advantage of the platform. âWe just felt like, âWell, we spend all our time on YouTube consuming sports content, but none of it is original content or first-person content or docu-style content that we would normally create for another platform,â Kleiman said. Durant’s YouTube channel launched in April 2017 — Kleiman likened it to Derek Jeter’s Playerâs Tribune or LeBron James’ Uninterrupted — and after a strong reception from fans, Durant and Kleiman are trying to bring other athletes onto the platform. In January, Thirty Five Media announced a deal with YouTube to create YouTube channels for athletes, including NFL star Richard Sherman and NBA star Karl-Anthony Towns. Safe harbor for publishers While Facebook Watch hasn’t taken off as a revenue source for publishers and the social network hasÂ deprioritized publisher content, YouTube offers something of a safe harbor for publishers that want to get into the video business.Â For example, publishers can direct-sell into their video on YouTube, said Kai Hsing, svp of marketing and operations at Bustle, which recently rekindled its interest in YouTube. YouTube was the most lucrative platform for publishers after Facebook, according to a Digital Content Next report. Publishers also recognize that people are going to YouTube specifically to watch videos. That’s a reason parenting publication Fatherly recently resurrected its YouTube channel. In January, Fatherly hired Adam Banicki, a former video producer at Vice, as its first vp of video. In February, it began uploading videos to its YouTube channel for the first time since June 2017. âWe all had the sense that the gross tonnage of views on Facebook was hitting a certain peak, and also, as a platform, Facebook didnât have the same degree of intentional viewership that a platform like YouTube did,â said Fatherly CEO Mike Rothman. Intentional viewing Producing serialized shows for YouTube also gives publishers a way to try out programs that TV networks or streaming services may want to develop into long-form programming. BothÂ Comedy Centralâs âBroad Cityâ and HBOâs âInsecureâÂ originated as YouTube channels. Publishers that are new to YouTube are looking hopefully to this opportunity. âBecause weâre dealing with more intentional viewers, [YouTube] serves as a better test bed than Facebook for launching teasers for longer-form programming, where the monetization strategy can be taking a pilot concept thatâs worked over a couple episodes on YouTube and then pitch to OTT or some other off-platform partner that can help us monetize through production financing and some kind of revenue split beyond that,â said Rothman. House of Highlights’ YouTube channel has only been up for a little more than a month, but the publisher is already exploring original, scripted shows as an alternative to the highlight reels it has primarily been uploading. âYouTube is a place that favors long-form viewing,” Bernstein said. “Itâs also more appointment viewing. On Facebook or other platforms, you scroll by, and itâs the surprise element.” Thirty Five Media has also been producing shows for Durantâs YouTube channel, including âParking Lot Chroniclesâ starring Durantâs teammate JaVale McGee and a comedy series featuring actor Michael Rapaport. And Kleiman has been meeting with YouTube about producing episodic shows for YouTube Red, the platformâs subscription service. âInstead of always having to sell a project, we can put something out on our YouTube channel and start to build a fan base and almost upstream it to YouTube Red or anywhere else on YouTube if the show takes off, or it could get picked up by major networks,â said Kleiman. But for all the value that media companies are seeing in YouTube, they have to be wary of overinvesting in it, as with any one platform, or expecting the money to come overnight. Refinery29 began putting a bigger focus on YouTube a year and a half ago, and in the second half of 2017, the publisher began focusing more on series to cultivate regular viewership. But Amy Emmerich, chief content officer atÂ Refinery29, expressed caution about the platform."}

Over the weekend, reports began to surfaceÂ that the firm, featuring Steve Bannon and Republican donor Robert Mercer in key roles, had acquired information from over 50 million Facebook users so that it could more effectively manipulate voters' behavior, according to The New York Times. Cambridge Analytica is being criticized for violating the privacy of millions of unsuspecting people to help Trump, while Facebook is being accused of potentially breaking American and British laws for failing to disclose to users that their data had been used by an outside firm. Cambridge Analytica has also been accused of knowingly employing non-American citizens to work on the 2016 presidential election, despite the fact that this violated federal law, according to The Guardian. Many of its methods were exposed in a recent piece from The Guardian that profiled eventual whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who, along with consulting company Strategic Communication Laboratories (which is the parent to Cambridge Analytica) and University of Cambridge professorÂ Dr. Aleksandr Kogan had their accounts suspended by Facebook on Friday night. Facebook is also looking into the ties between one of its employees, Joseph Chancellor, and Global Science Research, a company that helped Cambridge Analytica, according to CNN. One Facebook executive, Andrew Bosworth, took to Twitter to defend his company. We have suspended Cambridge Analytica from our platform for a clear violation our policies.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several U.S. Republican lawmakers expressed concern over privacy violations on Sunday after media reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's campaign gained inappropriate access to 50 million Facebook users' data. Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he believed some internet companies have grown too fast to digest their responsibilities and obligations. \"So we'll learn more about this in the days to come. But yeah I'm disturbed by that,\" Rubio told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" Senator Rand Paul was asked whether people can trust companies like Facebook in the wake of the report about Cambridge Analytica taking data. \"People have to look into it. Whether or not it broke the law, absolutely, the privacy of the American consumer, the American individual, should be protected,\" Paul said on CNN. Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it. Facebook said in a statement that a Cambridge University psychology professor had lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from an app he had developed. It suspended the firm from Facebook. Facebook did not immediately reply when asked on Sunday for a response to the lawmakers' comments. However, in a new statement Sunday, the company said it was conducting a \"comprehensive internal and external review\" to determine if the user data in question still existed. Cambridge Analytica and the professor have denied violating Facebook's terms, according to media reports. The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook's reputation, which was already under attack over Russians' use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections. Republican Senator Jeff Flake said he had a lot of questions about the data taken from Facebook, including who knew it had been taken and whether it is still being used. \"This is a big deal, when you have that amount of data, and the privacy violations there are significant,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union\" program. \"So the question is who knew it and when did they know it, how long did this go on and what happens to that data now.\" Facebook faced new calls for regulation from Democratic senators on Saturday and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards, but it was unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress would act. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said more investigation was needed. \"We need to find out what we can about the misappropriation of the privacy, the private information of tens of millions of Americans,\" he said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" Also on ABC, Senator James Lankford, a Republican, said it was not known whether the incident was connected to the Trump campaign."}

The company has faced a global outcry after a whistleblower revealed, on March 17, that data from 50 million users was improperly harvested to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections. “The last week showed how much more work we need to do to enforce our policies, and to help people understand how Facebook works and the choices they have over their data,” Erin Egan, Vice President and Chief Privacy Officer, and Ashlie Beringer, Vice President and Deputy General Counsel at Facebook, wrote in a blog post. “So in addition to Mark’s announcements last week — cracking down on abuse of the Facebook platform, strengthening our policies, and making it easier for people to revoke apps’ ability to use your data — we’re taking additional steps in the coming weeks to put people in more control over their privacy.” The measures come ahead of a landmark European Union data protection law in May. The social network will add a new “Privacy Shortcuts” menu which will let users worldwide review what they’ve shared and delete it, as well as features enabling them to download their data and move it to another service. Facebook shares have fallen almost 18 percent since March 17. Users’ data was improperly accessed by British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has repeatedly apologized and bought full-page advertisements in U.S. and British newspapers promising to do more to restrict access to users’ information. While Facebook said on Wednesday the changes it was announcing had been in the works for some time, it said the events of the “past several days underscore their importance.” The Privacy Shortcuts menu will allow users to control their data in a few taps, including by letting them add more protection to their account, like two-factor authentication. “You can review what you’ve shared and delete it if you want to. This includes posts you’ve shared or reacted to, friend requests you’ve sent, and things you’ve searched for on Facebook,” Egan and Beringer wrote. Users also will be able to manage the information Facebook utilizes to serve them ads and download the data they have shared with Facebook — including photos, contacts and posts — and move it to another service. The EU General Data Protection Regulation enters into force on May 25 and requires companies to give people a “right to portability”, namely to take their data with them. It also introduces hefty fines for companies breaking the law, running up to 4 percent of global revenues. Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are demanding to know more about Facebook’s privacy practices and Zuckerberg is due to testify before the U.S. Congress.

It trawls through the most apparently trivial, throwaway postings âthe âlikesâ users dole out as they browse the site â to gather sensitive personal information about sexual orientation, race, gender, even intelligence and childhood trauma. A few dozen âlikesâ can give a strong prediction of which party a user will vote for, reveal their gender and whether their partner is likely to be a man or woman, provide powerful clues about whether their parents stayed together throughout their childhood and predict their vulnerability to substance abuse. And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds. Some results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; âlikingâ a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window. But five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random âlikesâ could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments. When users liked âcurly friesâ and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; âBeing confused after waking up from napsâ was linked to sexuality. The researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook âlikesâ were public by default. âThe predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,â they said. âCommercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.â To some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinskiâs Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Koganâs duties at the university, but echoing Kosinskiâs work. Quick Guide How the story unfolded In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name. Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic âwarâ on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit. She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britainâs Electoral Commission and the Information Commissionerâs Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analyticaâs use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics. While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players. The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a âtextbook example of bad journalismâ. But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience. Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates. Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Muellerâs probing of the companyâs role in Donald Trumpâs presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live. The academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazonâs Mechanical Turk. The app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the takerâs Facebook account â and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well. The results were paired with each quiz-takerâs Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friendsâ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable. Aleksandr Kogan To be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 âseedersâ, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles â or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters. It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use. And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, â including Cambridge Analyticaâs political marketing â was strictly barred. It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another. The paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebookâs default terms allowed their friendsâ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a âclose working relationshipâ with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps. Facebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: âProtecting peopleâs information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, itâs a serious abuse of our rules.â See the full visual The scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the appâs ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he âspoke with an engineerâ to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed. Within months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals â a political approach known as âmicro-targetingâ. Facebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project. Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan âgained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channelsâ, but âdid not subsequently abide by our rulesâ because he passed the information onto third parties."}

After apologizing and working overtime to allay consumer fears, Facebook is now defending its use of data scraped from calls and texts sent on Android phones. Facebook uses phone-contact data as part of its friend recommendation algorithm. And in recent versions of the Messenger application for Android and Facebook Lite devices, a more explicit request is made to users for access to call logs and SMS logs on Android and Facebook Lite devices. But even if users didn't give that permission to Messenger, they may have given it inadvertently for years through Facebook's mobile appsâbecause of the way Android has handled permissions for accessing call logs in the past. Facebook denied the claim, writing in a blog post: âYou may have seen some recent reports that Facebook has been logging peopleâs call and SMS (text) history without their permission. This is not the case.â Facebook explained that users must opt in to share their mobile meta data. It wrote: Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This helps you find and stay connected with the people you care about, and provides you with a better experience across Facebook. People have to expressly agree to use this feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off inÂ settings, or here for Facebook Lite users, and all previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted. While we receive certain permissions from Android, uploading this information has always been opt-in only. However, Ars Technica questioned whether a service was really âopt inâ if the opt-in was a default setting: While data collection was technically \"opt-in,\" in both these cases the opt-in was the default installation mode for Facebook's application, not a separate notification of data collection. Facebook never explicitly revealed that the data was being collected, and it was only discovered as part of a review of the data associated with the accounts. The users we talked to only performed such reviews after the recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data. This latest spat over privacy protection comes as Facebook has launched a major effort to rebuild trust amid the unfolding Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a third-party organization obtained millions of usersâ data without their permission. Facebookâs public statement, posted on its press site, comes a couple of days after it took out full page newspaper ads to apologize for the misuse of data by third-party apps as it copes with fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal (follow the story as it develops here). In the ad, founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote âWe have a responsibility to protect your information. If we canât, we donât deserve it.â Some are demanding another apologyâand a better explanationâfrom the social media company. This time, the company has issued a statement saying it did nothing wrong. For one thing, it emphasizes that while it may be storing data about every phone call and text, including who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was, it did not actually record the content of those conversations and texts. (Is that supposed to make us feel like our privacy has been respected? Apparently Facebook thinks it should.) Contact importers might be common, but tracking and storing data about every call or text users make and receive is pretty uncommon, or at least I hope it is. Facebook appears to be deliberately ignoring the fact that there's a huge difference between these two things. Local news helps people connect to their communities about the issues that are closest to home. Earlier this year, we announced a change in the US to prioritize local news so people can see topics that have a direct impact on their community and discover whatâs happening in their local area. Today, weâre expanding that update to people in all countries, in all languages. Now, people around the world will see more news on Facebook from local sources covering their current city and other cities they may care about. However, the scandal seems unlikely to fade as users express their shock about the sorts of data they found in their Facebook downloads. Iâve just looked at the data files I requested from Facebook and they had every single phone number in my contacts. They had every single social event I went to, a list of all my friends (and their birthdays) and a list of every text Iâve sent. They have plundered my phone. They have phone numbers of people who arenât on Facebook. They have phone numbers of household names who, iâm sure, would be furious to know their phone numbers are accessible. Iâm appalled."}

The news comes after the Facebook founder and CEO turned down a summons from the UK parliament to face questions over the personal data harvesting controversy also involving data firm Cambridge Analytica. Whistleblower and former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie has alleged that the company gathered the details of 50 million users on Facebook through a personality quiz created by an academic in 2014. He alleges that because 270,000 people took the quiz, more data was harvested - mostly from the US - via their friend networks. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have disputed those numbers. Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people to help the company with their work on Donald Trump's presidential election campaign. The data company said none of the data was used for their work with President Trump's campaign. Facebook sources claim that Zuckerberg has come to terms with the fact that escalating pressure from the media, politicians and the public means he will have to testify before Congress within a matter of weeks, according to CNN Money. It would appear that the CEO has decided that Washington, not London will be the place where he will face questions, with Facebook currently planning the strategy for his testimony. It is not yet clear which committee Zuckerberg may testify in front of.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate Commerce committees have also asked him to testify but have not set dates. There have been some suggestions that Zuckerberg may testify in front of the Energy and Commerce Committee on 12 April. Theresa May, the British prime minister said she hoped Zuckerberg understood why people were concerned about alleged leaks of personal data, but it was up to him to decide whether to face the committee in Britain's parliament. âMr Zuckerberg will decide for himself whether he wants to come before the committee, but what I hope, is that Facebook will recognise why this is so significant for people and why it is that people are so concerned about it, and ensure that the committee is able to get the answers that they wantâ Ms May told parliament on Tuesday. The head of the committee, Damian Collins, who is leading an inquiry into \"fake news\" called Zuckerberg's decision âastonishingâ and urged him to think again. Zuckerberg will send a deputy from the company instead. Zuckerberg apologised last week for the mistakes Facebook had made and promised tougher steps to restrict third-party access to such information. Over the weekend, Zuckerberg took out full-page advertisements in several UK and US Sunday newspapers saying: âThis was a breach of trust, and I am sorryâ."}

Revelations over the weekend about its reckless sharing of user data sent its stock price plunging on Monday, and fresh calls for regulations on the social media network are looking more real than ever. In the last few days, multipleoutlets broke various facets of the story: Facebook has known since 2015 that Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining company hired by President Trumpâs election campaign, improperly obtained the personal data of 50 million of the networkâs usersâand the social giant failed to do much of anything about it. In a blog post on Friday, Facebook said it has suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL, while it investigates their alleged failure to comply with an agreement to delete the ill-gotten data. Advertisement The particulars of this case are relatively complex, but the most important thing to understand is that Facebook collects an enormous amount of data about its users, and it lost control of that data. When it found out, it asked the bad actors responsible to promise they would delete the data. Now Facebook claims that Cambridge Analytica and SCL may have failed to fulfill that promise. And whatever you do, Facebook execs say, donât call this a âbreach.â So after years of Facebook big shots telling us to just trust them when it comes to the ways it handles our data and targets us with advertising, a third-party allegedly violated Facebookâs trust. In the past, the company has met such scandals with a mixture of outright denials and promises to change, while mostly maintaining the status quoâand its bottom line just kept growing. On Monday, early market signs showed the dam could be breaking. This morning, Reuters reported that Facebookâs stock fell more than 4 percent in premarket trading. That trend has continued thoughout the day, with the stock down about 6.42 percent at the time of writing. Ripple effects spread to the Dow and Nasdaq as well. And analysts are warning investors to stay away from buying the dip right now. According to Reuters: One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised âsystemic problemsâ with Facebookâs business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform... âWe think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,â said Brian Wieser, analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group, which already has a âsellâ rating on a stock that rose 60 percent last year. Wieser argued that regulatory risks for the company would intensify and enhanced use of data in advertising would be at greater risk than before. He added, however, that it was unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the companyâs business for now, with advertisers unlikely to âsuddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform.â Advertisement Itâs true that Facebook has previously weathered similar storms by either outright denying any issues exist or promising to just keep tweaking that algorithm and rolling out new terms of service. But this time feels a bit different. Lawmakers around the world have vocally called for regulations, hearings, and investigations into this incident over the last few days and more continue to chime in. New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone insisted on Monday that âthe Energy and Commerce Committee must hold hearings soon.â That follows Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobucherâs demand that Mark Zuckerberg appear to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden grilling him with questions. On top of that, experts say that this case could easily be determined as a violation of the FTCâs consent decree that resolved a previous privacy case in 2011. If FTC investigators decided to throw the book at Facebook, they could potentially levy âtrillions of dollarsâ worth of fines against the company. Advertisement British Prime Minister Theresa May released a statement on Monday expressing her concerns about the story, and British Parliament member Damian Collins went further, saying, âSomeone has to take responsibility for this. Itâs time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.â In the past, Zuckerberg has typically addressed controversies with long essays on his personal Facebook page and promises to do better. But so far, the CEO has been quiet about this particular controversy. Weâve reached out to Facebook to ask if it has a timeframe for when Zuckerberg plans to address this incident personally and weâll update this post when we receive a reply. Facebookâs growth and revenue have consistently gone up over the years, but in late January the company reported that people were spending less time on the platform and it experienced its first-ever decline in daily users. As awareness grows about this incident, public wariness of Facebook is certain to increase. After all, how many other ânon-breachesâ have occurred just like this one? Advertisement But itâs lawmakers, above all, that Facebook and its investors need to fear. Protracted investigations and hearings could have a chilling effect on the companyâs stock as uncertainty grows. It will likely be alone in any fights against Washington as the tech industry looks for a sacrificial lamb to offer up in penance for its sins. And politicians around the globe are dealing with populist uprisings fueled by outside actors agitating through Facebookâin other words, they have an ax to grind. All of the mega-corporations of tech have misdeeds to account for, but Facebook is relatively unique in the ways that its platform has been used, and the extremely personal information it collects. Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytics employee who blew the whistle on this case, claimed in an interview with The Guardian that he âmade Steve Bannonâs psychological warfare tool.â While Wylie may have made the tool, it seems more and more clear that Mark Zuckerberg provided the steel, the forge, and the target."}

The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behaviour. But it did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016. An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica's drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm â and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics â under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic. Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\" \"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" he added. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\" The Guardian reported Sunday that at 17, Wylie worked in the office of the leader of the opposition, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion. A senior source with the Liberal party says Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. Details of Cambridge's acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm's psychographic modelling techniques. But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed â and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove. Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action. \"This was a scam â and a fraud,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all â and take action against all offending parties,\" Grewal said. Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook's rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was \"illegally acquired and used.\" In the United States, Mercer's daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees. Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company's role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election. While the substance of Mueller's interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm's British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users' identities, friend networks and \"likes.\" Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party. \"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do,\" Grewal said. \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\" Still, he added, \"it's a serious abuse of our rules.\" Reading voters' minds The Bordeaux flowed freely as Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate. Nix, a brash salesperson, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defence contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Barack Obama's campaigns. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters' behaviour and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University. The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said. Then a chance meeting bought Nix into contact with Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser; and with Mercer, one of the richest men on earth. Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America's culture and rewire its politics, recalled Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia's gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fundraiser. Although Cuccinelli lost, Mercer committed to moving forward. The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Nix was eager to win. When Wylie's colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Neugebauer, Nix castigated them over email. \"ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\" he wrote. Wylie's team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behaviour. But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew â a claim that has been disputed. When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs â more than $800,000 â and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records. All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\" He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million â a number previously reported by The Intercept â contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users â those who participated in the survey â had consented to having their data harvested. An international effort Just as Kogan's efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL's elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a licence to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie's team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica. The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European. In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the U.S. midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \"personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\" Nix \"never had any strategic or operational role\" in a U.S. election campaign, the company said. Whether the company's U.S. ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees' roles in each campaign and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules. After the leak By early 2015, Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favoured. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Wylie and other former \"contractors\" as engaging in \"what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\" Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \"carefully investigating this situation\" and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it. Facebook verified the leak and â without publicly acknowledging it â sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \"This data was obtained and used without permission,\" said a letter that was obtained by The New York Times. \"It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\" Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Kogan and \"SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\" But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook's control. The New York Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. While Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted. Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The New York Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations. All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica's political business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 mid-terms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump's re-election campaign. In the meantime, Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age â a \"Math Man,\" he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev but has not signed them on. Cambridge Analytica used personality quiz app to harvest social media data from over 50 million users, most without consent. LONDON â As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 U.S. midterm elections, it had a problem. The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of U.S. voters and influence their behaviour. But it did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the U.S. electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016. An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica's drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm â and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics â under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic. Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: \"Rules don't matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it's all fair.\" \"They want to fight a culture war in America,\" he added. \"Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.\" The Guardian reported Sunday that at 17, Wylie worked in the office of the leader of the opposition, who at that time was then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion. A senior source with the Liberal party says Wylie last worked for the party less than a decade ago, before Justin Trudeau became leader, and was also previously involved in its youth commission. Details of Cambridge's acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm's psychographic modelling techniques. But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed â and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm's emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but also still possesses most or all of the trove. Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action. \"This was a scam â and a fraud,\" Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all â and take action against all offending parties,\" Grewal said. Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Kogan for violating Facebook's rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the Brexit campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was \"illegally acquired and used.\" In the United States, Mercer's daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Bannon and Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees. Congressional investigators have questioned Nix about the company's role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department's special counsel, Robert Mueller, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election. While the substance of Mueller's interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm's British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users' identities, friend networks and \"likes.\" Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party. \"Protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do,\" Grewal said. \"No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\" Still, he added, \"it's a serious abuse of our rules.\" Reading voters' minds The Bordeaux flowed freely as Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate. Nix, a brash salesperson, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defence contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Barack Obama's campaigns. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters' behaviour and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University. The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said. Then a chance meeting bought Nix into contact with Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser; and with Mercer, one of the richest men on earth. Nix and his colleagues courted Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter, who shared his conservative views. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America's culture and rewire its politics, recalled Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia's gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fundraiser. Although Cuccinelli lost, Mercer committed to moving forward. The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Nix was eager to win. When Wylie's colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Neugebauer, Nix castigated them over email. \"ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??\" he wrote. Wylie's team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behaviour. But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University's Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew â a claim that has been disputed. When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Wylie found someone who would: Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs â more than $800,000 â and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records. All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \"a very standard vanilla Facebook app.\" He ultimately provided more than 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million â a number previously reported by The Intercept â contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users â those who participated in the survey â had consented to having their data harvested. An international effort Just as Kogan's efforts were getting underway, Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL's elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new U.S. company, owned almost entirely by Mercer, with a licence to the psychographics platform developed by Wylie's team, according to company documents. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica. The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Wylie, or European. In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the U.S. midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \"personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\" Nix \"never had any strategic or operational role\" in a U.S. election campaign, the company said. Whether the company's U.S. ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees' roles in each campaign and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules. After the leak By early 2015, Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favoured. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Wylie and other former \"contractors\" as engaging in \"what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\" Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \"carefully investigating this situation\" and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it. Facebook verified the leak and â without publicly acknowledging it â sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \"This data was obtained and used without permission,\" said a letter that was obtained by The New York Times. \"It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\" Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Kogan and \"SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\" But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook's control. The New York Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. While Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted. Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The New York Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations. All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica's political business. No U.S. campaigns or super PACs have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 mid-terms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Trump's re-election campaign. In the meantime, Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age â a \"Math Man,\" he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev but has not signed them on.

Facebook said it was suspending the accounts of Strategic Communication Laboratories, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, as well as the accounts of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies. Cambridge Analytica, a firm that specializes in using online data to create voter personality profiles in order to target users with political messages, ran data operations for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The company was funded by Trump supporter and hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and the president's former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon once sat on its board. The company, which began working for the Trump campaign in June 2016, promised that its so-called \"psychographic\" profiles could predict the personality and political leanings of every adult in the United States. The analytics firm was asked in December to turn over internal documents to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of the investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. Facebook said Kogan had requested and gained access to information from 270,000 Facebook members after they chose to download his app. The app, âthisisyourdigitallife,â offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as âa research app used by psychologists.â The Facebook members gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, the content they had likedÂ and some limited information about friend groups and contacts. Kogan then broke Facebook's policies and passed the information to Cambridge Analytica and to Wylie. Facebook learned about Kogan's activities in 2015. The company removed Kogan's app at the time and demanded certifications from Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan that the information he had shared had been destroyed. All three certified to Facebook that they had done so, but Facebook said it received reports several days ago that the data was not deleted. âWe are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims,â the company said. âIf true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.â Cambridge Analytica did not respond to immediate requests for comment. The company's methods of data collection have been criticized by other researchers. âCambridge Analytica overstates their capabilities because they play in the shadows. They willingly cheat and ignore privacy rules and data ethics in order to win,\" said social media analyst Jonathan Albright,Â research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. Facebook is under significant pressure to control and be more transparent about how political operatives use its platform. Russian agents abused the companyâs systems to target millions of American voters with disinformation during the 2016 election. The Trump campaign also made heavy use of Facebook, and the social network faced criticism for sending Facebook staff to embed with campaign staffers. Facebook said this was standard practice for large political and corporate spenders.

The idea, in theory, would let Snapchat users grant outside companies access to their Snapchat data to help personalize other services. Mashable saw a beta version of Snapchat with a new section called âConnected Apps,â with text that reads, âThese apps are connected to your Snapchat account. Choose an app to control what it has access to.â Snapchat currently has an advertising API so people can buy ads through third-party dashboards, but it doesnât let people use their Snapchat account on other apps, or help people connect with their Snapchat friends on other platforms. Facebook does, and has for years. An old version of that API, which allowed outside developers to collect data from users without their consent, is at the center of the companyâs entire Cambridge Analytica scandal. The fact that Snapchat is considering sharing some data with outsiders is interesting in general, but particularly interesting given the recent news about Facebook. There are a lot more questions than answers about the potential product. For example, what would connecting your Snapchat account to another app actually grant that developer? Would they have access to your contact list or private Snap messages? Would Snapchat let you post back to your account from other services? A Snap spokesperson declined to comment, and the company is likely thinking a lot about those very questions, given the current climate around privacy sharing. Hopefully, Snapchat will learn from Facebookâs mistakes whenever it decides to roll this out. Until now, Snap has stayed pretty far out of the spotlight when it comes to data collection and user privacy, probably because so many of the interactions on Snap are in private messages. (And many of its users are smartphone natives who may better understand what theyâre handing overâ or simply not care.) But Snap is also an advertising company like Facebook, and it collects a lot of data about its users so it can show them relevant ads. You can read about some of that here. The fact that itâs considering an API is also a reminder of why Facebook continues to collect this kind of stuff about its own user base, despite the issues itâs facing â if Facebook isnât going to do it, somebody else will."}

Read the latest.) LONDON â As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem. The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work. So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social networkâs history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trumpâs campaign in 2016. An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analyticaâs drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm â and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics â under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic. Image Both Congress and the British Parliament have questioned Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, about the firmâs activities.CreditBryan Bedder/Getty Images Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: âRules donât matter for them. For them, this is a war, and itâs all fair.â âThey want to fight a culture war in America,â he added. âCambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.â Details of Cambridgeâs acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firmâs so-called psychographic modeling techniques. But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed â and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firmâs emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove. Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes. During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action. âThis was a scam â and a fraud,â Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. âWe will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all â and take action against all offending parties,â Mr. Grewal said. Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebookâs rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago. In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the âBrexitâ campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was âillegally acquired and used.â In the United States, Mr. Mercerâs daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees. Image The conservative donor Robert Mercer invested $15 million in Cambridge Analytica, where his daughter Rebekah is a board member.CreditPatrick McMullan, via Getty Images Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the companyâs role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Departmentâs special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election. While the substance of Mr. Muellerâs interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firmâs British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trumpâs Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on usersâ identities, friend networks and âlikes.â Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party. âProtecting peopleâs information is at the heart of everything we do,â Mr. Grewal said. âNo systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.â Still, he added, âitâs a serious abuse of our rules.â Reading Votersâ Minds The Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate. Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obamaâs campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect votersâ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University. The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said. Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth. Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift Americaâs culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment. Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginiaâs gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward. The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win. When Mr. Wylieâs colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email. âITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??â he wrote. Mr. Wylieâs team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior. But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages. Image Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, built an app that helped the firm harvest Facebook data. Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge Universityâs Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew â a claim that has been disputed. When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs â more than $800,000 â and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records. All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was âa very standard vanilla Facebook app.â He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million â a number previously reported by The Intercept â contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users â those who participated in the survey â had consented to having their data harvested. Image An email from Dr. Kogan to Mr. Wylie describing traits that could be predicted. Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was âthe saving graceâ that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers. âWe wanted as much as we could get,â he acknowledged. âWhere it came from, who said we could have it â we werenât really asking.â Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Koganâs contributions as âfruitless.â An International Effort Just as Dr. Koganâs efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCLâs elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylieâs team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica. The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European. But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections. In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself âfrom substantive managementâ of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, âto manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.â In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all âpersonnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.â Mr. Nix ânever had any strategic or operational roleâ in an American election campaign, the company said. Whether the companyâs American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employeesâ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules. Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees. Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trumpâs digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support. Image The White House advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Kellyanne Conway with Ms. Mercer at the 2017 inauguration. The firm helped the Trump campaign target voters. Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firmâs profiles helped shape Mr. Trumpâs strategy â statements disputed by other campaign officials â but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters. In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on âlegacy psychographicsâ built for the Cruz campaign. After the Leak By early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored. Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former âcontractorsâ as engaging in âwhat is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.â Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was âcarefully investigating this situationâ and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it. Facebook verified the leak and â without publicly acknowledging it â sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. âThis data was obtained and used without permission,â said a letter that was obtained by the Times. âIt cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.â Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and âSCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.â Image Cambridge Analytica harvested over 50 million Facebook usersâ data, one of the largest data leaks in the social networkâs history.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty Images But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebookâs control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained. While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted. Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations. All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analyticaâs political business. No American campaigns or âsuper PACsâ have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trumpâs re-election campaign. In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age â a âMath Man,â he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on.

In addition to the civil money penalty, the casino is required to conduct periodic external audits to examine its anti-money laundering (AML) BSA compliance program and provide those audit reports to FinCEN and the casinoâs Board of Directors. Trump Taj Mahal, a casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, admitted to several willful BSA violations, including violations of AML program requirements, reporting obligations, and recordkeeping requirements. Trump Taj Mahal has a long history of prior, repeated BSA violations cited by examiners dating back to 2003. Additionally, in 1998, FinCEN assessed a $477,700 civil money penalty against Trump Taj Mahal for currency transaction reporting violations. \"Trump Taj Mahal received many warnings about its deficiencies,\" said FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery. \"Like all casinos in this country, Trump Taj Mahal has a duty to help protect our financial system from being exploited by criminals, terrorists, and other bad actors. Far from meeting these expectations, poor compliance practices, over many years, left the casino and our financial system unacceptably exposed.\" Trump Taj Mahal admitted that it failed to implement and maintain an effective AML program; failed to report suspicious transactions; failed to properly file required currency transaction reports; and failed to keep appropriate records as required by the BSA. Notably, Trump Taj Mahal had ample notice of these deficiencies as many of the violations from 2012 and 2010 were discovered in previous examinations. Director Shasky Calvery expressed her appreciation to the Internal Revenue Service, Small Business/Self-Employed Division, which performed the examinations of Trump Taj Mahal, for their contributions to the investigation and for their strong partnership with FinCEN. She also thanked the Commercial Litigation Branch of the U.S. Department of Justice for their assistance with this enforcement action. Trump Taj Mahal petitioned for bankruptcy in September 2014. That bankruptcy remains pending. The Bankruptcy Court approved of Trump Taj Mahalâs settlement on March 4, 2015. FinCEN seeks to protect the U.S. financial system from being exploited by illicit actors. Its efforts are focused on compromised financial institutions; third-party money launderers; transnational organized crime; terrorist and other security threats; significant fraud; and threats to cyber security. FinCEN has a broad array of enforcement authorities to target both domestic and foreign actors affecting the U.S. financial system. FinCEN's mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit use and combat money laundering and promote national security through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence and strategic use of financial authorities."}

Beginning on October 7 last year, WikiLeaks published hundreds of emails from the private account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta. The daily drops continued for a couple days after the November 8 election. On Thursday, as US media were speculating about “Russian” meddling on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit, Julian Assange tweeted some of the Podesta emails with a reminder that the social network’s leading lights were Clinton fans. In February 2015, Podesta was copied on an email from Clinton aide Cheryl Mills, who said she had arranged for Sandberg and her researcher to visit the office and “step through the research on gender and leadership by women.” That visit took place one hour before a “main meeting” concerning Clinton. In June 2015, Sandberg wrote an email to Podesta, saying she would “still want HRC to win badly.” “I am still here to help as I can. She came over and was magical with my kids,” Sandberg wrote. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO and founder of Facebook, sent a personal email to Podesta in August 2015, saying he enjoyed spending time with him, and that their conversation gave him “a lot to think about.” Zuckerberg thanked Podesta for sharing his experiences with the Center for American Progress (CAP), a Democratic think tank founded by Podesta. Included in the thread was an email to Podesta from Elliot Schrage, the vice president of communications at Facebook, who said Zuckerberg was looking for a way to “direct his wealth to have an impact as great as Facebook” adding that Podesta’s ideas had “really moved his thinking.” Zuckerberg then asked Podesta if he could reach out in the future to hear his ideas and said he was looking forward to continuing their conversation. “I hope it’s okay if I reach out as my thinking develops to get your ideas and reactions,” Zuckerberg said. “If there are any other folks you think I should talk to, please let me know.” Some Twitter users were quick to point out the hypocrisy behind Democrats spending so much time and energy investigating all the major social media sites, desperately searching for any possible collusion between President Donald Trump and Russia, even though Facebook colluded with Clinton."}
{"originalUrl":"https://www.eugdpr.org/the-regulation.html","title":"Key Changes with the General Data Protection Regulation – EUGDPR","text":"GDPR Key Changes An overview of the main changes under GDPR and how they differ from the previous directive The aim of the GDPR is to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches in todayâs data-driven world. Although the key principles of data privacy still hold true to the previous directive, many changes have been proposed to the regulatory policies; the key points of the GDPR as well as information on the impacts it will have on business can be found below. Increased Territorial Scope (extraterritorial applicability) Arguably the biggest change to the regulatory landscape of data privacy comes with the extended jurisdiction of the GDPR, as it applies to all companies processing the personal data of data subjects residing in the Union, regardless of the companyâs location. Previously, territorial applicability of the directive was ambiguous and referred to data process ‘in context of an establishment’. This topic has arisen in a number of high profile court cases. GDPR makes its applicability very clear – it applies to the processing of personal data by controllers and processors in the EU, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not. The GDPR also applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects in the EU by a controller or processor not established in the EU, where the activities relate to: offering goods or services to EU citizens (irrespective of whether payment is required) and the monitoring of behaviour that takes place within the EU. Non-EU businesses processing the data of EU citizens also have to appoint a representative in the EU. Penalties Organizations in breach of GDPR can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover or â¬20 Million (whichever is greater). This is the maximum fine that can be imposed for the most serious infringements e.g.not having sufficient customer consent to process data or violating the core of Privacy by Design concepts. There is a tiered approach to fines e.g. a company can be fined 2% for not having their records in order (article 28), not notifying the supervising authority and data subject about a breach or not conducting impact assessment. It is important to note that these rules apply to both controllers and processors – meaning ‘clouds’ are not exempt from GDPR enforcement. Consent The conditions for consent have been strengthened, and companies are no longer able to use long illegible terms and conditions full of legalese. The request for consent must be given in an intelligible and easily accessible form, with the purpose for data processing attached to that consent. Consent must be clear and distinguishable from other matters and provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. It must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.â Data Subject Rights Breach NotificationUnder the GDPR, breach notifications are now mandatory in all member states where a data breach is likely to âresult in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individualsâ. This must be done within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach. Data processors are also required to notify their customers, the controllers, âwithout undue delayâ after first becoming aware of a data breach. Right to Access Part of the expanded rights of data subjects outlined by the GDPR is the right for data subjects to obtain confirmation from the data controller as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose. Further, the controller shall provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge, in an electronic format. This change is a dramatic shift to data transparency and empowerment of data subjects. Right to be Forgotten Also known as Data Erasure, the right to be forgotten entitles the data subject to have the data controller erase his/her personal data, cease further dissemination of the data, and potentially have third parties halt processing of the data. The conditions for erasure, as outlined in article 17, include the data no longer being relevant to original purposes for processing, or a data subject withdrawing consent. It should also be noted that this right requires controllers to compare the subjects’ rights to “the public interest in the availability of the data” when considering such requests. Data Portability GDPR introduces data portability – the right for a data subject to receive the personal data concerning them – which they have previously provided in a ‘commonly use and machine readable format’ and have the right to transmit that data to another controller. Privacy by Design Privacy by design as a concept has existed for years, but it is only just becoming part of a legal requirement with the GDPR. At its core, privacy by design calls for the inclusion of data protection from the onset of the designing of systems, rather than an addition. More specifically, ‘The controller shallâ¦ implement appropriate technical and organisational measuresâ¦ in an effective way… in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects’. Article 23 calls for controllers to hold and process only the data absolutely necessary for the completion of its duties (data minimisation), as well as limiting the access to personal data to those needing to act out the processing. Data Protection Officers Under GDPR it is not necessary to submit notifications / registrations to each local DPA of data processing activities, nor is it a requirement to notify / obtain approval for transfers based on the Model Contract Clauses (MCCs). Instead, there are internal record keeping requirements, as further explained below, and DPO appointment is mandatory only for those controllers and processors whose core activities consist of processing operations which require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale or of special categories of data or data relating to criminal convictions and offences. Importantly, the Data Protection Officer: Must be appointed on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge on data protection law and practices May be a staff member or an external service provider Contact details must be provided to the relevant DPA Must be provided with appropriate resources to carry out their tasks and maintain their expert knowledge Must report directly to the highest level of management Must not carry out any other tasks that could results in a conflict of interest.â âDisclaimer: This is not an official EU Commission or Government resource.

Two Cambridge University academics with expertise in using Facebook data for scientific research claim they were approached by marketing firm Cambridge Analytica to work with the firm but refused on ethical grounds. David Stillwell, deputy director of The Psychometrics Centre at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., is known for his research and expertise in harnessing the power of big data through social media, in particular with his myPersonality project. The personality quiz began on Facebook in June 2007, when the social network had a much smaller pool of users. It was worked on by fellow Cambridge expert Michal Kosinski, and it was a successâgarnering over 8 million respondents and helping psychologists with their scientific research. David Stillwell, left, and Michael Kosinski reportedly rejected working with Cambridge Analytica on ethical grounds. Fellow Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan introduced the two men in 2014 to Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL), the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, which proposed providing funds to Koganâs company to collect new data from Facebook users. Â Â Stillwell and KosinskiÂ told Sky News they refused this arrangement and raised concerns about the research with Cambridge University. They provided an email thread to the British news organization, detailing Kosinski’sÂ worries over the proposal. Kosinski wrote: âIn my opinion his approach is highly unethical, but I am not sure if it is worth to stir before his plans are actually materialized (e.g. he receives the contract).â âThere is a large chance that he will either correct his ways or simply fail to get it anyway,â Kosinski said. Facebook has been reeling in the face of accusations that it didnât do enough to prevent 50 million users’ data from being harvested without their consentâand later allegedly used to micro-target voters by the Trump campaign. The company has apologized, recently with full-page newspaper adsÂ in the U.S. and U.K.. It has also seen someÂ advertisersÂ raise concerns and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been called to testify before lawmakers in Washington, D.C., something he has said he would be open to. Cambridge Analytica says it deleted the data as soon as it was asked to by Facebook and that it did nothing wrong. Facebook has promised to do a full audit of the apps on its platform to determine how they are handling user data.Â âI hope that our character is supported by the evidence that we did not continue with the project and that we raised our concerns with the university once it became clear what Dr. Kogan planned to do,â Stillwell told Sky News. Kogan has not made any recent public comments, but has previously stated that he feels he is being turned into a scapegoat. Christopher Carbone is a reporter for FoxNews.com.

For some, this is an indication that their online data isnât safe; the #DeleteFacebook hashtag began trending shortly after the news broke, and though the numbers arenât in, users may be leaving the platform in droves. For others, itâs yet another indication of the tragic state of modern politics, since the ill-gotten data was used as part of President Trumpâs 2016 campaign. But for marketers like me, this is a learning experience. This is an interesting scandal for a few different reasons, and Facebook executives have done a poor job of explaining it fully to the public, or recovering from this veritable PR disaster. So whatâs really happening here, and what should marketers learn from this experience? What Really Happened If itâs hard to find a concise explanation of what happened, thereâs a reasonâthis is a complicated situation. Hereâs the gist of what happened: several years ago, Facebook exposed data from 50 million users to an academic researcher, who used a quiz app to pull more user data than he should have reasonably gotten. That researcher then sold that user data to analytics firm Cambridge Analytica (CA). CA then used that user data as part of Trumpâs marketing and advertising campaign. Since then, the FTC has announced an investigation, hoping to learn more about how Facebook handles user data, and there have been calls for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. Facebookâs stock has plunged in the days following. Again, this leaves out several details, but the gist of the story is whatâs important for our purposes. How Facebook Responded When the news broke, the media went crazy, and users demanded an answer for what they perceived to be a serious misuse of their data. It took Mark Zuckerberg several days to respond, but he eventually wrote an extended post about the situation on Facebook. Zuckerberg outlined a timeline of events, from 2007 to present day, explaining what happened, and pointing out that Facebook already took steps in 2014 to prevent this kind of thing from happening. Zuckerberg also apologized, and mentioned new updates on the horizon designed to give users more transparency about how their data is collected and used. A few days later, Zuckerberg purchased full-page ads in multiple national newspapers, reiterating some of what was included in his Facebook message and prominently stating: âWe have a responsibility to protect your information. If we canât, we donât deserve it.â It was an impressive step to take, but it didnât come until more than a week after the initial news broke. Could Facebook Have Recovered? This is a big, important, story, but its effects could have been mitigated had Facebook acted faster. The initial app began collecting data as early as 2013, and Facebook pressured Cambridge Analytica to delete their data in 2015âbut it took until a week after news of the scandal broke to start publicly addressing user concerns. By that point, underinformed users were freaking out and deleting the app, and the media was dragging the Facebook brand through the mud, calling for Zuckerberg to speak up. A major point of this scandal is its secrecyânobody knew this data was being collected or usedâso further attempts to obfuscate the truth, or run from it, only made matters worse for Facebook. What Marketers Can Learn Now for the important part. What can we, as marketers, learn from this incident? Be proactive. Nobody can predict the future, but you can be proactive by getting ahead of the news whenever you can. Announcing a PR scandal before it hits mainstream headlines gives you the chance to control the message, and set the tone. By the time Facebook got to chime in, sensationalist headlines had already made Facebook out to be the bad guy in the situation. Offer transparency. Trust in corporations is at an all-time low. Offering transparency is a gesture of good faith to your audience, building their trust in your organization. Withholding details, or being perceived that youâre withholding details, can be a death sentence for your brand. Even if you look bad because of it, itâs almost always better to be honest. Respond quickly. One of Facebookâs biggest mistakes was waiting several days before responding officially to news of the scandal. If you canât get ahead of a PR scandal or a bit of bad news about your company, you better be sure you act fast in response to it. The longer your customers spend thinking about the situation, the more time theyâll have to form opinions about what happened, and why. Even if youâre missing some of the details, you need to make a statement. Admit fault. Zuckerberg did a great job of providing details regarding the incident in his blog post, but (perhaps rightfully) spent much of the post discussing how the researcher and Cambridge Analytica were to blame for the incident. At the end of the post, he did admit fault, though in a fairly general sense rather than specifically, stating âI started Facebook, and at the end of the day Iâm responsible for what happens on our platform.â Admitting fault is vital if you want your statement to be taken seriously, and itâs important to outline what you will do to prevent the problem from happening again. Zuckerberg did a great job of outlining this in his post. Apologize. Offering a sincere apology, and telling customers how you failed them is a gesture of humility, and is often the first step to restoring trust. While Zuckerberg did a good job of telling users how Facebook failed them, Zuckerberg did not issue a direct apology in his post, which several users pointed out in the comments section of it. Regardless of how you feel about Facebook, or how you feel about the state of modern online user privacy, this is a classic example of a PR disaster and brand management in action. Itâs hard to say if better marketing and PR moves could have prevented the severity of this media-blasted nightmare for Facebook, but you can certainly use this information to improve your own brandâs imageâregardless of whether you have any scandals in your future.

{"originalUrl":"https://corporateeurope.org/power-lobbies/2017/10/big-data-watching-you","title":"Big Data is watching you | Corporate Europe Observatory","text":"Big Data is watching you The industry lobby battle against ePrivacy This week, MEPs on the Civil Rights Committee will vote on the ePrivacy regulation, which will determine how secure our data is when we are online. For the past 16 months, industry lobbies, including all those who collect or use citizensâ personal online data for advertising purposes, have been vigorously opposing new proposals on ePrivacy. On the other side of the debate, digital rights campaigners demand that citizens should enjoy optimum data privacy when online. Industry has used tried and tested techniques straight out of the lobbyistsâ playbook to influence the outcome of ePrivacy deliberations in the Commission and the Parliament. These tactics have included one-to-one lobby meetings, coordinating industry sign-up letters, mobilising corporate members, commissioning research to support industry positions, and holding or sponsoring elite events. A pro-privacy version of the Commissionâs proposal which was leaked in December 2016 pumped further adrenalin into the corporate campaign, concerned about how its bottom line would be affected. Evidence indicates that member states in the Council such as Germany could be promoting industry positions. Key to some industry lobbyistsâ strategy has been the attempt to reframe the debate so that it is not about privacy but instead about media plurality, combatting fake news, and even the future of the internet, and they have regularly woven key EU buzzwords and policy mantras such as âbetter regulationâ and âinnovationâ into their appeals to policy-makers. Overall, one Parliamentary insider has characterised ePrivacy as âone of the worst lobby campaigns I have ever seenâ. What is ePrivacy? âWeâve lost control of our personal data,â said Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the web on its 28th anniversary earlier this year. Everytime you are online, via a laptop, computer, or smartphone, you are under commercial surveillance. Your digital data including the content of your emails, the websites you browse, and the purchases you have made, together with metadata (data which includes to whom, when, and where your communications are sent) is monitored and collected, including via tracking cookies and other mechanisms. This sensitive information is then sold on and used to target commercial advertising or political messaging at you, and can be used by governments too. EPrivacy must therefore ensure the confidentiality of your online communications. This can be done, for example, by banning interference in your communications (calls, chats, texts, Skype callsâ¦); by making sure that settings on new equipment and software are designed and set at the highest privacy level âby defaultâ; and that consumers who refuse to be tracked cannot be banned from visiting particular websites. ePrivacy regulation It was always clear that the topic of ePrivacy would be the focus of serious lobbying. Part of the Digital Single Market initiative, and closely related to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which was updated in 2016 after a long lobby battle (you can read Corporate Europe Observatoryâs analysis of aspects of corporate influence on the GDPR here), the new ePrivacy regulation updates existing provisions (dating from 2002 and 2009) to take account of new and emerging technologies and platforms, and to harmonise it with the GDPR. On ePrivacy, industry does not always speak with one voice. Telecoms companies are already subject to the current ePrivacy rules but newer platforms which enable you to communicate online such as Facebook, Google, WhatsApp, and Skype are not. Telecoms companies, already unhappy about the ePrivacy laws they must adhere to, would like them to be scarpped. Failing that, they at least want to level the playing field so that newer providers have to follow the same rules. The newer platforms would obviously prefer to keep things much as they currently are, and for ePrivacy rules not to apply to them. Meanwhile the companies that provide online advertising fear that ePrivacy changes will undercut their current business model. This model relies on tracking usersâ web-browsing, analysing metadata and content in communications, and monitoring the use of TVs and other devices, so that advertising can be targetted. The online advertising and marketing lobbies have closely collaborated on the ePrivacy dossier with newspaper and magazine publishers who are increasingly reliant on online advertising revenue derived in this way. Facebook and Google, to name just two, are also heavily reliant on surveillance-based advertising revenue, earned by monitoring usersâ electronic communications. On the other side of the debate, the European Data Protection Supervisor (the EU's independent data protection authority), digital rights campaigners and consumer advocates point to the fundamental rights laid out in the EU treaties, especially on data privacy and the right to a private life. BEUC points out that âconsumers should have the possibility to use online services without being under constant commercial surveillanceâ. Public opinion appears to back this approach. In the Commissionâs consultation on ePrivacy, 81 per cent of the individual citizens who responded demanded âprivacy by defaultâ settings to be activated on all new IT equipment. According to a Eurobarometer survey, 89 per cent of its respondents agreed with that suggestion. By contrast, a majority of industry respondents to the Commissionâs consultation favoured self- or co-regulation instead. â¬1,000,000 - â¬1,249,999 â¬300,000 - â¬399,999 (2016) 2.75 9 Industry lobbyists warm up In the run up to the publication of the Commission's ePrivacy regulation in January 2017 there were a host of industry lobby initiatives following on from the Commissionâs consultation process. And while some individual companies held behind-the-scenes lobby meetings with senior Commission officials during 2016 (Deutsche Telekom had five meetings; Facebook, two; Google, three; and Microsoft, five), many left it to their respective trade associations to lead the public charge. Large parts of the tech and telecoms industries have been opposed to the whole concept of a revised ePrivacy law. Trade associations representing app developers, publishers, telecoms companies, advertisers, and other digital service providers publicly united to demand that the ePrivacy Directive was simply repealed. A statement issued in July 2016 included 12 trade associations who argued that because the new proposal would overlap with the GDPR, the existing ePrivacy directive (which industry often refers to as the âcookie lawâ to undermine its privacy value) could be simply scrapped rather than updated. This was an ironic argument for industry to make, considering that many of them had lobbied hard (albeit mostly unsuccessfully) to gut the GDPR. The lobby groups were careful to reference REFIT, part of the Commissionâs controversial deregulation drive, and another EU buzz word âinnovationâ, in their argumentation as to why a new ePrivacy law is not needed. Telecoms trade body ETNO (European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association) followed up in early September with a study conducted on its behalf by law firm DLA Piper which (surprise, surprise) backed ETNOâs view that âthe ePrivacy Directive is outdated and no longer needed.â¦ Most of its provisions, if not all, should therefore be repealed.â Commissioning studies from think tanks or law firms which end up supporting your case is a familiar lobby tactic in Brussels. Another familiar tactic is organising high-profile conferences. The invitation-only ETNO conference in September 2016 saw Digital Single Market Commissioner Andrus Ansip and (then) Digital Economy Commissioner GÃ¼nther Oettinger, together with Roberto Viola (Director-General of the lead department for ePrivacy, DG Connect) speaking to the telecoms industry. Just a couple of months later, a further telecoms industry conference, this time organised by ECTA (European Competitive Telecommunications Association), brought together Ansip, Viola, and many of the key industry lobbyists again. Yet another conference in December 2016 specifically on data protection and ePrivacy, sponsored by Microsoft and Deutsche Telekom among others, brought together lobbyists, DG Connect officials, and VÄra JourovÃ¡, another EU Commissioner with oversight of this topic, thanks to her consumer protection portfolio. But not all interactions took place in these large fora. An evening meeting between Oettinger, the board of the magazine publishers association EMMA, and a delegation of European publishers sounds rather more intimate, and was then followed by a Q&A with EMMA members. Other invitation-only events, and private lobby meetings all provided ample opportunities for industry to ensure that the Commission knew its positions on ePrivacy during the proposal drafting phase. In 2016 there were at least 41 lobby meetings held with Commissioners Ansip or Oettinger, their cabinet members, or Director-General Roberto Viola, which clearly included discussions on ePrivacy. Of these 41 meetings, 36 (88 per cent) were with corporate interests and only 5 were with civil society, indicating a high degree of corporate bias. This very much fits with the pattern of corporate privileged access previously exposed by ALTER-EU which showed that Oettinger and Ansip, responsible for ePrivacy in 2016, were the Commissioners with the second and fourth highest proportions of corporate meetings, with 83 per cent and 78 per cent respectively. In fact, as Politico has pointed out, Oettinger, who âwon the gratitude of some of Europeâs telecom giants and big media publishersâ, continued to meet with lobbyists from the tech world in 2017 despite being appointed to an entirely different portfolio (the EU budget) in January. However, the figure of 41 meetings is likely to be an under-estimate. Commission-organised stakeholder roundtables do not seem to be included in this list, while many other private lobby meetings may well have touched upon these issues (on data protection or the Digital Single Market, for example), but did not include ePrivacy on the reported agenda. This number also excludes the meetings held by officials not subject to the Commissionâs proactive transparency rules, namely the entirety of DG Connect, aside from its Director-General. On 23 November 2016, Ansip met with a group of seven industry lobby groups - interactive advertising (IAB Europe), publishers (EPC), magazine publishers (EMMA), newspaper publishers (ENPA), communications agencies (EACA), direct and interactive marketing (FEDMA), and interactive digital advertising (EDAA) - specifically on ePrivacy. This meeting followed a joint letter to Ansip and Oettinger from IAB Europe and EMMA, with the support of over 90 European publishers, which typifies the attempts of the industry to reframe the political debate on ePrivacy. The advocates of the letter argue: âMedia plurality, and ultimately functioning democracies, depend on media having diverse revenue streams. These must include advertising.â The letter invokes moral arguments to defend what is, in fact, simply a current business model based on tracking, and implies that it is the only viable form of online advertising. (A recent blog by digital rights campaign EDRi dissects the key arguments of proponents of the tracking-based advertising model and discusses alternatives.) The industry letter, once again, cites the Commissionâs Better Regulation (deregulatory) agenda, a key EU mantra, and argues for voluntary rather than legally-binding regulation. Leaked proposal provokes lobby flurry By December 2016, the ePrivacy debate was really hotting up, and then a leaked version of the Commissionâs proposed regulation (complete with spelling mistakes, a sure indication it was not the final version) appeared on the Politico website around 12 December 2016. While digital rights activists mostly welcomed the proposals, there was another flurry of furious lobbying when industry discovered the leaked draft contained several proposals which were anathema to it. (For an overview of the leaked proposal, The International Association of Privacy Professionals and The Data Protection Network published analyses at the time.) IAB Europe led industry reaction to the leak, telling the Financial Times, without any sense of hyperbole, that the leaked Commission proposal was âputting at risk the entire internet as we know itâ, a reference to the proposal in the leaked version that users should give prior permission to receive targetted advertising. Days after the leak, the consumer rights umbrella group BEUC wrote to Ansip and Oettinger and President Juncker on ePrivacy. Without referencing the leaked proposal directly, BEUC expressed support for some of its key elements and held a meeting with Oettinger on 20 December which included discussions on ePrivacy. But BEUC was seriously out-gunned by the numbers of corporate lobbyists accessing decision-makers around this time. On 19 December 2016, an informal coalition of at least 14 heavyweight industry trade associations met with Commissioner Ansip directly. This meeting was fortuitously scheduled, coming only a few days after the leak which had been causing such a stir. While the meeting was ostensibly about the implementation of the GDPR, it would have been a good opportunity to raise the leaked proposal. Attendees included the European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT), telecoms trade body ETNO, BusinessEurope, DigitalEurope, IAB Europe, CCIA, FEDMA, and others. In fact industry lobbied all the way up to Christmas 2016 to push its agenda. On 20 December, ETNO and GSMA publicly wrote to Commissioners Timmermans, Ansip, Oettinger, and JourovÃ¡ criticising what they called the ârestrictive and conservative policy approachâ in the leaked regulation, including âthe reliance on consent on consentâ. On 22 December, DigitalEurope issued a public statement to criticise the leaked proposal as âundermining the balance of the digital ecosystemâ¦ disproportionate andâ¦ likely to be ineffectiveâ. The statement made 11 separate criticisms of the leaked draft, including on âprivacy by designâ and cookies. It was signed by 12 trade associations including AmCham EU, EACA, EDiMA, FEDMA, and IAB Europe. On the same day, a separate but overlapping group of trade associations, this time of European publishers, the digital advertising industry, and direct marketers, and which included EMMA, ENPA, EACA, FEDMA, and IAB Europe, wrote to Ansip and Oettinger to express their concerns especially about âthe proposals on browser settings, third party cookies and privacy by designâ. The letter repeated the demand that they would just prefer to see the whole ePrivacy rules binned, âas the first, best optionâ. A freedom of information request to the Commission to request minutes of industry lobby meetings on ePrivacy has remained (at the time of writing) unanswered, four months after it was tabled, so we do not know the detail of what was discussed in any of the meetings detailed above. But it is safe to assume that by the time ePrivacy officials and Commissioners left for their 2016 Christmas break, they would all have been exceedingly clear about industryâs demands. Commissionâs final proposal On 10 January 2017 the Commission published its final proposal and some key things had changed since the leaked draft. Absent were proposals to ensure default ePrivacy settings on computer equipment, and to allow the equivalent of US-style class actions to make mass privacy complaints. Included was a weaker definition of metadata. La Quadrature du Net, an NGO defending digital rights, said at the time: âThis regulation proposal does have some interesting elements but it doesn't challenge the economic model of the digital industry based on the exploitation of personal data. So, last minute concessions given to advertisers and telecoms are already too big considering there are still months left of negotiations where lobbies of the industry will have all the time to undermine the text. At this time, the proposal doesn't address the concern of EU citizens on the protection of their electronic communications.â EDRi took a similar line, stating that the text âseems to have [been] watered down considerablyâ¦ the official draft proposal released in January 2017 falls far short of that earlier text in certain key areasâ but also noted that the âEuropean Commission has resisted the most extreme demands from certain parts of industryâ. It is impossible to say exactly what impact all the heavy corporate lobbying had on the final Commission proposal. It seems that the changes between the leaked and final versions were instigated at the Cabinet (rather than DG Connect) level and that the advertising lobby had been especially influential. Certainly lobby groups promoting the tracking-based advertising model were very active during this period, and a comparison of the leaked and final proposals makes it clear that the Commission did change the text in ways with which industry lobbies would have approved. The leak occurred during the intra-Commission consultation on the proposal and it seems a plausible, although unproved, theory that the leak came from pro-industry forces within the Commission who were keen to generate sufficient outrage from industry so as to extinguish proposals seen as being too pro-privacy. The final proposal indicates that industry lobbyists won the day on some important issues. Nonetheless, advertising lobby group IAB Europe maintained its hard-line stance in its post-release public statement which continued to demand the ârepealing [of the] outdated and unnecessary cookie lawâ. Similarly EMMA and ENPA (representing magazine and newspaper publishers respectively) seemed angry that their lobbying, which they referred to as âa significant number of meetings and exchanges with the European Commissionâ, had not delivered what they wanted. Industry lobby switches focus to MEPs The industry lobby bandwagon now headed to the European Parliament where Estoniaâs Marju Lauristin MEP (Social Democrat) became Rapporteur on the dossier for the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) committee. As a previous Shadow Rapporteur on the GDPR, Lauristin was already well versed in the arguments on both sides of the debate and was likely to steer through a pro-privacy approach. With Lauristin returning to national Estonian politics by the end of the year, completing the report rapidly became an urgent task. Throughout 2017 industry has maintained its lobby pressure via a series of one-to-one lobby meetings, sponsored events, industry sign-up letters, cocktail debates, and roundtable discussions with MEPs. MEPs on the relevant committees were being bombarded with demands from industry to read briefings, hold lobby meetings, and table draft amendments. If the lengthy GDPR debate was the biggest ever EU lobby battle on tech issues, the ePrivacy dossier has run it a close second and the lobbying has been intense. Rapporteur Lauristin and her staff have held over 140 meetings with lobbyists on all sides of the debate and in total, over 800 amendments have been tabled. La Quadrature du Net analysed the amendments and highlighted a cluster of MEPs from the EPP and ECR groups (centre right/ right wing) who adopted a pro-industry, anti-privacy perspective. In early summer 2017 MEP Rapporteurs and lobbyists packed into a small room in the Parliament for one of a series of roundtables to try to move the ePrivacy debate forward. Every seat was taken and as the temperatures in the cramped room rose, so did tempers. Some industry lobbyistsâ behaviour at that meeting was subsequently described as ârudeâ, âimpoliteâ, and even âaggressiveâ, especially when they interrupted other speakers, or made dismissive comments about othersâ interventions. The Digital Assembly 2017 was held in Valletta in June. Organised by the Commission and the Maltese Presidency of the Council of the EU, it provided a lobby opportunity for those working on various aspects of the Digital Single Market. Packed with Commission officials, member state and permanent representation staff, and key MEPs on the ePrivacy dossier (including Lauristin and Shadow Rapporteur MichaÅ Boni), the tech industry lobby was out in full force. While NGOs represented a handful of delegates, DigitalEurope sent six; Google, seven; Microsoft, four; Vodafone, five; TelefÃ³nica, four; and Apple, three; while a number of lobby firms including APCO, Cabinet DN, Cambre, Edelman, FTI Consulting, Hanover, and Kreab, were also among the delegates. Also in June, the Developers Alliance and IAB Europe held a round-table discussion in the European Parliament on âThe impact of the proposed ePrivacy Regulation on the data-driven ecosystemâ, with MEPs MichaÅ Boni and Daniel Dalton. The event was framed as how the draft ePrivacy regulation would impact upon âinnovative companiesâ, innovation being a key EU policy mantra which is often used to mean that nothing must get in the way of business doing business. In a blog to review the event IAB Europeâs Chief Executive slammed Lauristinâs draft LIBE committee report as taking an âextreme approachâ, and asked whether the new ePrivacy rules, especially in the light of the MEPâs report, would âkill the online advertising business modelâ or âjust handicap itâ. In fact, by criticising the âenvironment of hysteria over tracking that currently grips Brusselsâ in a different blog, it seemed as if IAB Europe was not afraid to have a pop at anyone with opposing views. This seems to include the European Data Protection Supervisor, the EU's independent data protection authority. It has supported tougher privacy protections throughout this process and has recently taken on the arguments used by supporters of surveillance-based advertising. By September 2017, pro-privacy MEPsâ frustration with industry lobbies publicly surfaced at a debate on âHow the new privacy rules might impact a free and independent pressâ, organised by EMMA (magazine media) and EDAA (interactive digital advertising). According to IAPPâs report on the event, LIBE Rapporteur Lauristin told industry: âIt is important to have a dialogue, but I am sorry to say it feels like we are listening to you, trying to take into account what you say, and yet we see no change in your responses.â âPrivacy is a fundamental right. It is on a par with other fundamental rights, itâs not a political position. So whatever business models you develop you will have to respect that right. It is not negotiable. Full stop.â¦ Every time we pass a piece of legislation, I hear the same cries of alarm saying it is going to kill this or that industry. If that was true every time, there would not be a single business left in Europe, so letâs not dramatise.â Even Martin Selmayr, President Junckerâs Chief of Staff, has warned industry that lobbying around exaggerated claims would not work, according to a report in Politico. âIâve seen this âend-of-the-world scenarioâ beforeâ¦ Iâd advise not to go into another five years of lobbyingâ, in a reference to the GDPR, he apparently told tech lobbyists. All in all, the approach of some industry lobbyists has really alienated some MEPs. A parliamentary source speaking to Corporate Europe Observatory anonymously characterised overall industry lobbying on ePrivacy â especially by the online advertising and media lobbies â as âalways aggressiveâ and as âone of the worse I have ever seenâ. While the civil liberties (LIBE) committee has lead responsibility for ePrivacy, several other committees have now finalised their opinions. EDRi and La Quadrature du Net criticised the final opinion of the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs Committee (IMCO) for supporting the bypassing of usersâ consent. EDRi criticised the âavalanche of broadly pro-Google lobbyingâ focussed on IMCO which led to its final opinion reducing the scope of the ePrivacy regulation and weakening the safeguards for citizensâ. The Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) Committee has âproposed a mix of positive and negative changes to the textâ, according to EDRi, while La Quadrature du Net called it âpretty much the same calamityâ as the IMCO report. A third committee, Legal Affairs (JURI), has also produced an opinion. The Rapporteur, centre-right MEP Axel Voss, produced a draft opinion which was packed full of pro-industry amendments and argued that the ePrivacy proposal should ârefrain from focusing on consentâ. In the end, Vossâ report was so heavily amended by pro-privacy MEPs that he asked to have his name removed from it. Member states get ready for ePrivacy Council debate As is usually the case in EU decision-making, the situation in the Council is more opaque than in the Parliament. Member states are handling this dossier slowly and delegations are still checking legal issues, including how the ePrivacy regulation fits with the GDPR. A final Council position is not expected until the end of the year. But there are some worrying signs, including that this dossier is being handled by telecoms officials from member states (via the Telecommunications Working Party) which could imply that positions are more likely to be pro-industry. By contrast, the GDPR was handled by data protection officials. The Council debate on privacy issues has been underway for some time. A May 2017 progress report from the (Maltese) Council Presidency stated that âA number of delegations would welcome more thorough analysis of the impact... on specific market players, in particular on online advertising companies and/or on business models using third-party cookies.â A discussion was due to be held on 10 July to specifically discuss overlaps with the GDPR and cookies; the Council has said that minutes of this and other meetings of the Telecommunications Working Party do not exist. Over the summer of 2017 delegations shared their emerging positions with other member states. According to papers passed to Corporate Europe Observatory, a group of countries (Greece, Portugal, Latvia) have made proposals to toughen up the Commissionâs privacy proposals. However Germany is already mooting a possible dilution. A position paper on ePrivacy drafted by the German Government which was dated August 2017 and circulated to member state delegations, stated that provisions on tracking cookies and consent needed to be âcarefully reviewed and be discussed in much more detailâ. It continued: âThese are provisions are highly significant for both companies and private individuals alike. These provisions need to protect the right to informational self determination. At the same time, they must not preclude the development and use of legitimate business models; this notably applies to business models that ensure access to information that is influential on userâs opinion. The relevant provisions ought to be practical and reflect the interests of users and service providers alike.â [Emphasis added.] This will be a red flag to digital rights activists, but will perhaps not come as any great surprise. Corporate Europe Observatory has previously written about the lobby influence of the German publishersâ lobby, the power of the Spanish telecoms sector, and the willingness of these member states to absorb industry positions as their own. The BDI (the Federation of German Industries) has recently lobbied MEPs on the LIBE committee about what it called the âdisproportionate provisionsâ on ePrivacy currently being discussed. The most recent draft of the (Estonian) Council Presidencyâs proposal on ePrivacy, dated September 2017, does not make substantial proposals for change to the privacy provisions, although proposing to extend the period of time for which users might be reminded to check their privacy settings from 6 to 12 months, is perhaps a worrying sign. Furthermore, there is some suggestion that member states will insert new security provisions to require companies to retain consumersâ data, which will be controversial with both MEPs and citizens. However, overall the jury remains out in terms of how Council will finally position itself on ePrivacy. Next steps MEPs on the LIBE committee will vote on 19 October 2017 on MEP Lauristinâs report, whose pro-privacy approach is expected to remain intact despite the industry lobbiesâ overwhelming effort to undermine it. Parliamentary insiders say that even at this late stage lobbyists are continuing to contact MEPs, some on a daily basis. Just days before the LIBE vote, industry lobbyists (in the form of the Industry Coalition for Data Protection which includes AmCham EU, DigitalEurope, IAB Europe, EACA, EDiMA, FEDMA, and others) circulated yet another open letter which warns MEPs that they should âcarefully consider the practical implications both for businesses and consumers of the proposed ePrivacy Regulation text before a voteâ. On Twitter, pro-privacy MEPs such as Rapporteur Lauristin and Green group Shadow Rapporteur Jan Philipp Albrecht have had to fend off angry industry lobbyists. Meanwhile IAB Europe, EMMA, ENPA, EACA, FEDMA and others have now produced a series of short videos likening the ePrivacy proposal to a âbad movieâ and depicting a future world where ePrivacy has undermined the fight against âfake newsâ, and citizens have been left feeling âexhaustedâ and âconfusedâ because they have had to consent to privacy settings. Luckily EU decision-makers, so far, have not caved into industryâs scaremongering. While the Commission acquiesced to some corporate lobby demands in its final draft of January 2017, it did enough to ensure that industryâs demands to firstly jettison the whole dossier and then to render it toothless were not implemented. MEPs, under the leadership of Lauristin, have fought back against the corporate lobbyists. But there remains an open question as to how the Council will handle ePrivacy. This is likely to depend upon how successful national corporate lobbyists will be in bending the ear of sympathetic member state officials. Looking forward to the trilogue phase of this dossier, it will be vital that all EU decision-makers â MEPs, member state officials, the Commission â remain alert to the claims of corporate lobbyists, and take a particularly sceptical approach towards those who insist that online privacy and a flourishing internet cannot co-exist. Update 19 October 2017 Today, MEPs on the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) committee voted to accept the report of rapporteur Marju Lauristin MEP on ePrivacy, with 31 votes in favour compared to 24 against. A series of compromise amendments had been reached between key political groups in recent days, but the centre-right EPP had refused to endorse both these and the entire report. Digital rights activists have broadly welcomed the results which include privacy-by-default settings in new software, and an end to âcookie wallsâ which companies can use to deny access to their website or service if a consumer does not consent to being tracked. EDRi said: âDespite a huge lobbying effort to water down the proposal, the Committee voted for clear, privacy-friendly rules. We welcome this approach, as it will not just protect citizens, but promote competition and innovation as wellâ. Consumer rights organisation BEUC said: âIt's alarming that the online companies who claim to be the trendsetters and the engine of the digital economy cling to an advertising business model based on snooping on people. It is a great step that the European Parliament today has put consumers in the driving seat again.â However La Quadrature du Net pointed to weaknesses in the report, including allowing websites to track users without their consent for âweb audience measuringâ and allowing companies to track devices in the streets without our consent. Industry responded in expected ways. IAB Europe defended the EPP minority which tried to block the report, and said it was âmystifyingâ that a majority of MEPs did not support a âvibrant, independent media that can hold power to accountâ, once again trying to reframe the debate away from ePrivacy. ETNO tried to reframe the issue around âinnovation and consumer choiceâ saying it regretted todayâs vote. With the Council next in line to agree its position, before the trilogue can start, we can be sure that the industry lobbying will only intensify. Update 24 October 2017 \"By November, our communications secrecy could be dead all across the EU...\" Today, centre-right MEPs have secured the votes needed to send MEP Lauristin's report to the Strasbourg plenary on Thursday (26th) for a full vote. If a majority vote to re-open the dossier, new amendments can then be tabled. Those following the dossier inside and outside the Parliament have confirmed to CEO that \"lobby efforts are going through the roof right now\" and that corporate lobby \"campaigning started immediately after the LIBE vote\" last week.Â Update 30 October 2017 Last week MEPs in plenary voted to support the LIBE mandate to enter into trilogue with the other institutions on ePrivacy. As rapporteur Marju Lauristin MEP said: \"Todayâs vote is a victory for citizenâs rights over the lobbying efforts of big business.\" Lauristin is now due to return to Estonian national politics and she will be replaced as rapporteur by Birgit Sippel who said: \"There have been many myths circulating about this report spread by industrial lobbyists who are engaged in a misleading campaign. We are pleased that the majority of the Parliament has seen sense and allowed us to move forward with these important new rules.\" Get our monthly newsletter Follow us on social media The political climate in the Czech Republic has grown increasingly repressive following the election of oligarch Andrej BabiÅ¡ as prime minister in October 2017. With the Czech civil society space squeezed tighter and tighter by BabiÅ¡'s government, we want to help draw attention to the duress and threats under which many progressive organisations and media outlets now have to work. In the following interview, our Czech board member Jakub PatoÄka explains what is at stake in the country as targeted defamation campaigns and funding withdrawals risk to make the work of critical NGOs and newspapers increasingly difficult. Industry lobbyists are spending millions of euros to influence an upcoming EU decision on labelling titanium dioxide â found in everyday products like sunscreenÂ â a âsuspected carcinogenâ. The lobbying is led by an unregistered trade association and a public relations consultancy; nonetheless, they appear to have the ear of member states and the European Commission. We pay our taxes, so why donât corporations? The Big Four are embedded in EU policy-making on tax avoidance and this report concludes that it is time to kick this industry out of EU anti-tax avoidance policy. The European Commission rebranded AirBnB lobbying documents as âcommercial secretsâ and therefore denied public access. After eight months of wrangling over their release, Corporate Europe Observatory can report the documents show that AirBnB and similar rental platforms are attacking measures used by cities to protect affordable housing."}

Mr. Trump has long suggested that allegations that he or his campaign conspired with Russia to influence the election were a âhoaxâ and part of a âwitch hunt,â but until this weekend he had largely heeded the advice of lawyers who counseled him not to directly attack Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for fear of antagonizing prosecutors. âWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?â Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. âAnother Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!â The attack on Mr. Mueller, a longtime Republican and former F.B.I. director appointed by a Republican president, George W. Bush, drew immediate rebukes from some members of the party who expressed concern that it might presage an effort to fire the special counsel. Such a move, they warned, would give the appearance of a corrupt attempt to short-circuit the investigation and set off a bipartisan backlash. âIf he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because weâre a rule-of-law nation,â Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an ally of the president, said on âState of the Unionâ on CNN. âWhen it comes to Mr. Mueller, he is following the evidence where it takes him, and I think itâs very important he be allowed to do his job without interference, and there are many Republicans who share my view.â Among them was Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a sharp critic of Mr. Trump who appeared on the same program. âPeople see that as a massive red line that canât be crossed,â he said. He urged Mr. Trumpâs advisers to prevail on him not to fire Mr. Mueller. âWe have confidence in Mueller.â Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, said if the president was innocent, he should âact like itâ and leave Mr. Mueller alone, warning of dire repercussions if the president tried to fire the special counsel. âI would just counsel the president â itâs going to be a very, very long, bad 2018, and itâs going to be distracting from other things that he wants to do and he was elected do,â Mr. Gowdy said on âFox News Sunday.â âLet it play out its course. If youâve done nothing wrong, you should want the investigation to be as fulsome and thorough as possible.â The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, issued a statement likewise warning Mr. Trump to back off. âAs the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job,â said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman. His counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had no comment, as did a number of other top Senate Republicans. Late in the day, the White House tried to douse the furor. âIn response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the administration, the White House yet again confirms that the president is not considering or discussing the firing of the special counsel, Robert Mueller,â Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer, said in a statement. The presidentâs tweet followed a statement by Mr. Trumpâs personal lawyer, John Dowd, on Saturday calling on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Trump followed up that evening with a tweet arguing that âthe Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.â The two weekend tweets were the first time Mr. Trump has used Mr. Muellerâs name on Twitter, not counting a message he once retweeted, and reflected what advisers called a growing impatience fueled by anger that the investigation was now looking at his business activities. The New York Times reported last week that Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed records from the Trump Organization. Mr. Trumpâs lawyers met with Mr. Muellerâs team last week and received more details about how the special counsel is approaching the investigation, including the scope of his interest in the Trump Organization. For months, Mr. Trump had been reassured by his lawyers that the investigation would wrap up soon â by Thanksgiving, then Christmas, then New Yearâs. But with the expansion into Mr. Trumpâs business, it seems increasingly clear that Mr. Mueller is not ready to conclude his inquiry. A top adviser to Mr. Trump said on Sunday that the White House had grown weary of the inquiry. âWe have cooperated in every single way, every single paper theyâve asked for, every single interview,â Marc Short, the presidentâs legislative director, said on âFace the Nationâ on CBS. âThereâs a growing frustration that after a year and millions and millions of dollars spent on this, there remains no evidence of collusion with Russia.â A president cannot directly fire a special counsel but can order his attorney general to do so. Even then, a cause has to be cited, like conflict of interest. Since Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former campaign adviser, has recused himself from the Russia investigation â to Mr. Trumpâs continuing irritation â the task would fall to the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. But Mr. Rosenstein said as recently as last week that he sees no justification for firing Mr. Mueller, meaning that he would either have to change his mind or be removed himself. The third-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rachel Brand, knowing this issue could reach her, decided last month to step down. The next official in line would be the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, a former White House and Justice Department lawyer under Mr. Bush. Mr. Trump sought to have Mr. Mueller fired last June but backed down after his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit. The president told The Times a month later that Mr. Mueller would be crossing a red line if he looked into his familyâs finances beyond any relationship with Russia. The White House made no assertion last week that the subpoena to the Trump Organization crossed that red line, but Mr. Trump evidently has grown tired of the strategy of being respectful to the special counsel. His focus on Democrats working for Mr. Mueller could be aimed at demonstrating conflict of interest that would merit dismissal. When Mr. Mueller assembled his team, he surrounded himself with trusted former colleagues and experts on specific crimes like money laundering. As the team filled out, Republican allies of Mr. Trump noted that some members had previously contributed to Democratic candidates. In particular, Republicans pointed to Andrew Weissmann, who served as F.B.I. general counsel under Mr. Mueller. Mr. Weissmann is a career prosecutor but, while in private law practice, donated thousands of dollars toward President Barack Obamaâs election effort. In his Sunday morning Twitter blasts, Mr. Trump also renewed his attacks on James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Andrew G. McCabe, his former deputy, both of whom, like Mr. Mueller, are longtime Republicans. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last May, at first attributing the decision to the F.B.I. directorâs handling of the investigation into Hillary Clintonâs private email server but later telling an interviewer that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he made the decision. Mr. Sessions, under intense public pressure from Mr. Trump, fired Mr. McCabe on Friday after an inspector general found that he had not been forthcoming about authorizing F.B.I. officials to provide information about the Clinton inquiry in 2016 to a reporter. âWow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked âhave you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?ââ Mr. Trump wrote. âHe said strongly ânever, no.â He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.â Mr. Trump went on to dismiss reports that Mr. McCabe kept detailed memos of his time as deputy F.B.I. director, just as Mr. Comey did. Mr. McCabe left those memos with the F.B.I., which means Mr. Muellerâs team has access to them. âSpent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,â Mr. Trump wrote. âI donât believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?â Michael R. Bromwich, Mr. McCabeâs lawyer, fired back by accusing the president of corrupting the law enforcement system. âWe will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,â he wrote on Twitter. âThe whole truth will come out in due course. But the tweets confirm that he has corrupted the entire process that led to Mr. McCabeâs termination and has rendered it illegitimate.â In suggesting that Mr. Comey lied under oath to Congress, Mr. Trump appeared to refer to a comment by Mr. McCabe that the former director had authorized the news media interaction at the heart of the complaint against him. The presidentâs Republican allies picked up the point on Sunday and pressed for appointment of a prosecutor to look at the origin of the Russia investigation. âSo we know that McCabe has liedâ because the inspector general concluded he had not been fully candid, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, said on Fox News. âNow heâs saying about Comey â Comey may have lied as well. So I donât think this is the end of it. But thatâs why we need a second special counsel.â Other Republicans, however, suggested that the Trump administration was going too far. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida criticized the decision to fire Mr. McCabe on a Friday night shortly before his retirement took effect, jeopardizing his pension. âI donât like the way it happened,â Mr. Rubio said on âMeet the Pressâ on NBC. âHe shouldâve been allowed to finish through the weekend.â Speaking of the president, he added: âObviously he doesnât like McCabe and heâs made that pretty clear now for over a year. We need to be very careful about taking these very important entities and smearing everybody in them with a broad stroke.â"}

Though Facebook claims Cambridge Analytica and its associates broke the rules in retaining and using this data, this wasnât a breach as we typically think of them: The Times reported that 270,000 of those users willingly gave over their info when they signed up for a personality quiz app. Developers can request to see your relationship status, education history, and religious and political beliefs, among many other data points, but only if you allow them. For example, I had unknowingly shared all of my Facebook photos and photos tagged of me with TripAdvisor. A hiking app called AllTrails could see all of the timeline posts, while Waze had access to my custom friend lists (including one named âFrenemiesâ). In any case, now would be a good time to revisit the third-party apps youâve granted permission to access your Facebook data and review â and maybe revoke â some of the info youâre sharing. Alternatively, on the desktop interface, click the downward arrow in the top-right corner and select Settings. Then select Apps from the menu. On the apps page, youâll see all the apps where youâve logged into Facebook. On mobile, tap the menu bar (bottom-right for iOS, top-right for Android), and select Settings > Account Settings > Apps > Logged in with Facebook. Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News Remove third-party apps you no longer use by hovering over the icon and clicking the \"X.\" Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News You can also adjust the amount of information you hand over to an app by clicking the edit button. Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News You can limit an appâs permissions without fully revoking it. Click on the edit button (pencil icon), next to the remove button, to view each appâs individual settings, where you can see all of the data thatâs visible to the app. You can revoke specific permissions by deselecting the checkmark next to each data point. Third-party apps may have already stored data on you, and youâll need to contact the app developer to delete that information. You can do this on Facebook in the appâs individual settings page. On the bottom right-hand corner of the settings window, click on Report App. Then select, I want to send my own message to the developer. There, you can request that they remove any information they have stored. Itâs not a guarantee, however, that they will respect your request. Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News Look at the appâs privacy policy to see more details about how that app is using your data. In the same row of links in tiny font next to Report App, click on App Privacy Policy, which will take you to the appâs website. There will be a lot of legal mumbo jumbo in here, so just search (command + F) for âFacebookâ or âsocial networksâ to go straight to the section that covers integration with social networks. Another thing to look at on Facebookâs app settings page: Apps Others Use. This module is near the bottom of the page, underneath the third-party app icons. Click Edit to control what your friends on Facebook can bring with them when they enable third-party apps. Deselect the personal info you donât want to share. Your friends could be sharing your religious and political views or what youâre interested in, without your knowledge (or theirs). If you want to download a copy of all your data, thatâs an option, too. You can download all of your Facebook data â including posts, photos, videos, messages, chats, and your âaboutâ section â by going to Settings and in General, clicking Download a copy of your Facebook data. The ultimate takeaway is: Review app permissions, not just on Facebook, but forall social media sites, and look closely at what information youâre allowing third-party apps to see. Nicole Nguyen / BuzzFeed News Facebook's privacy policy changes from time to time (as former Facebook executive Alex Stamos pointed out in now-deleted tweets), so re-check your third-party app settings regularly, to make sure you're only sharing information what you want to be sharing. The apps you connected with Facebook before 2014, for example, might have access to an insane amount of Facebook data, because that was the default permissions setting at that time.

Facebook has come under intense scrutiny from users, lawmakers and investors following allegations from a whistleblower that it allowed British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica to improperly use data and build voter profiles that were later used to help elect US President Donald Trump in 2016. US lawmakers on Friday officially requested that Facebook's Mark Zuckaberg explain at a congressional hearing how users' data was released to the consultancy. The data debacle has sparked intense debate over the responsibility of large tech firms to properly inform users of how their data is used. \"If you're going to use these technologies, you have to tell people you're doing that, and they should never be surprised,\" IBM chief executive Rometty said on Monday. \"(We have to let) people opt in and opt out, and be clear thatÂ ownership of the data does belong to the creator,\" said Rometty. It comes as China, where the forum was held, is also looking to bolster personal privacy regulations following a series of missteps by leading tech firms including search firm Baidu and Alibaba Group payment affiliate, Ant Financial. \"China has become increasingly more aware of this problem and have been enforcing the relevant laws more definitely and strongly,\" said Baidu chief Robin Li at the same event on Monday. \"I think the Chinese people are more open, or less sensitive about the privacy issue. If they are able to trade (privacy) for convenience, safety or efficiency â in a lot of cases they are willing to do that,\" said Li. In January a consumer group from Jiangsu in east China filed a lawsuit against Baidu claiming the firm was illegally collecting personal data. Copyright 2018 IDG Communications. ABN 14 001 592 650.

This idiom reflects the ever closer union between the State Department and Silicon Valley, as personified by Mr. Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google , and Mr. Cohen, a former adviser to Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton who is now director of Google Ideas. The authors met in occupied Baghdad in 2009, when the book was conceived. Strolling among the ruins, the two became excited that consumer technology was transforming a society flattened by United States military occupation. They decided the tech industry could be a powerful agent of American foreign policy. The book proselytizes the role of technology in reshaping the worldâs people and nations into likenesses of the worldâs dominant superpower, whether they want to be reshaped or not. The prose is terse, the argument confident and the wisdom â banal. But this isnât a book designed to be read. It is a major declaration designed to foster alliances. âThe New Digital Ageâ is, beyond anything else, an attempt by Google to position itself as Americaâs geopolitical visionary â the one company that can answer the question âWhere should America go?â It is not surprising that a respectable cast of the worldâs most famous warmongers has been trotted out to give its stamp of approval to this enticement to Western soft power. The acknowledgments give pride of place to Henry Kissinger , who along with Tony Blair and the former C.I.A. director Michael Hayden provided advance praise for the book. In the book the authors happily take up the white geekâs burden. A liberal sprinkling of convenient, hypothetical dark-skinned worthies appear: Congolese fisherwomen, graphic designers in Botswana , anticorruption activists in San Salvador and illiterate Masai cattle herders in the Serengeti are all obediently summoned to demonstrate the progressive properties of Google phones jacked into the informational supply chain of the Western empire. The authors offer an expertly banalized version of tomorrowâs world: the gadgetry of decades hence is predicted to be much like what we have right now â only cooler. âProgressâ is driven by the inexorable spread of American consumer technology over the surface of the earth. Already, every day, another million or so Google-run mobile devices are activated. Google will interpose itself, and hence the United States government, between the communications of every human being not in China (naughty China). Commodities just become more marvelous; young, urban professionals sleep, work and shop with greater ease and comfort; democracy is insidiously subverted by technologies of surveillance, and control is enthusiastically rebranded as âparticipationâ; and our present world order of systematized domination, intimidation and oppression continues, unmentioned, unafflicted or only faintly perturbed. The authors are sour about the Egyptian triumph of 2011. They dismiss the Egyptian youth witheringly, claiming that âthe mix of activism and arrogance in young people is universal.â Digitally inspired mobs mean revolutions will be âeasier to startâ but âharder to finish.â Because of the absence of strong leaders, the result, or so Mr. Kissinger tells the authors, will be coalition governments that descend into autocracies. They say there will be âno more springsâ (but China is on the ropes). The authors fantasize about the future of âwell resourcedâ revolutionary groups. A new âcrop of consultantsâ will âuse data to build and fine-tune a political figure.â âHisâ speeches (the future isnât all that different) and writing will be fed âthrough complex feature-extraction and trend-analysis software suitesâ while âmapping his brain function,â and other âsophisticated diagnosticsâ will be used to âassess the weak parts of his political repertoire.â An error has occurred. Please try again later. You are already subscribed to this email. The book mirrors State Department institutional taboos and obsessions. It avoids meaningful criticism of Israel and Saudi Arabia . It pretends, quite extraordinarily, that the Latin American sovereignty movement, which has liberated so many from United States-backed plutocracies and dictatorships over the last 30 years, never happened. Referring instead to the regionâs âaging leaders,â the book canât see Latin America for Cuba . And, of course, the book frets theatrically over Washington âs favorite boogeymen: North Korea and Iran . Google, which started out as an expression of independent Californian graduate student culture â a decent, humane and playful culture â has, as it encountered the big, bad world, thrown its lot in with traditional Washington power elements, from the State Department to the National Security Agency . Despite accounting for an infinitesimal fraction of violent deaths globally, terrorism is a favorite brand in United States policy circles. This is a fetish that must also be catered to, and so âThe Future of Terrorismâ gets a whole chapter. The future of terrorism, we learn, is cyberterrorism. A session of indulgent scaremongering follows, including a breathless disaster-movie scenario, wherein cyberterrorists take control of American air-traffic control systems and send planes crashing into buildings, shutting down power grids and launching nuclear weapons. The authors then tar activists who engage in digital sit-ins with the same brush. I have a very different perspective. The advance of information technology epitomized by Google heralds the death of privacy for most people and shifts the world toward authoritarianism. This is the principal thesis in my book, âCypherpunks.â But while Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Cohen tell us that the death of privacy will aid governments in ârepressive autocraciesâ in âtargeting their citizens,â they also say governments in âopenâ democracies will see it as âa giftâ enabling them to âbetter respond to citizen and customer concerns.â In reality, the erosion of individual privacy in the West and the attendant centralization of power make abuses inevitable, moving the âgoodâ societies closer to the âbadâ ones. The section on ârepressive autocraciesâ describes, disapprovingly, various repressive surveillance measures: legislation to insert back doors into software to enable spying on citizens, monitoring of social networks and the collection of intelligence on entire populations. All of these are already in widespread use in the United States. In fact, some of those measures â like the push to require every social-network profile to be linked to a real name â were spearheaded by Google itself. THE writing is on the wall, but the authorsÂ cannot see it. They borrow from William Dobson the idea that the media, in an autocracy, âallows for an opposition press as long as regime opponents understand where the unspoken limits are.â But these trends are beginning to emerge in the United States. No one doubts the chilling effects of the investigations into The Associated Press and Foxâs James Rosen. But there has been little analysis of Googleâs role in complying with the Rosen subpoena. I have personal experience of these trends. The Department of Justice admitted in March that it was in its third year of a continuing criminal investigation of WikiLeaks . Court testimony states that its targets include âthe founders, owners, or managers of WikiLeaks.â One alleged source, Bradley Manning , faces a 12-week trial beginning tomorrow, with 24 prosecution witnesses expected to testify in secret. This book is a balefully seminal work in which neither author has the language to see, much less to express, the titanic centralizing evil they are constructing. âWhat Lockheed Martin was to the 20th century,â they tell us, âtechnology and cybersecurity companies will be to the 21st.â Without even understanding how, they have updated and seamlessly implemented George Orwell âs prophecy. If you want a vision of the future, imagine Washington-backed Google Glasses strapped onto vacant human faces â forever. Zealots of the cult of consumer technology will find little to inspire them here, not that they ever seem to need it. But this is essential reading for anyone caught up in the struggle for the future, in view of one simple imperative: Know your enemy. Julian Assange is the editor in chief of WikiLeaks and author of âCypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet.â A version of this op-ed appears in print on June 2, 2013, on Page SR4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Banality of âDonât Be Evilâ.

Damian Collins, who leads the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, had written to Mr Zuckerberg directly requesting that he appear. Mr Collinsâs letter made the request in the strongest possible terms, and suggested that Mr Zuckerberg himself should appear. He gave until Monday evening to reply to the request. Mark Zuckerberg on Cambridge Analytica: 'I'm really sorry' How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you 1/9 Lock your profile down If you havenât done this already, do it now. In Settings, hit the Privacy tab. From here, you can control who gets to see your future posts and friends list. Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu. 2/9 Limit old posts Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on whoâs able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up. 3/9 Make yourself harder to find You can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. Itâs also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. At the bottom of the page is the option to prevent search engines outside of Facebook from linking to your profile. 4/9 Control access to your Timeline You can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. 5/9 Block people When you block someone, they wonât be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. You can also add friends to your Restricted list here, which means theyâll still be friends with you but will only be able to see your public posts and things you share on a mutual friend's Timeline. 6/9 Review tags One of Facebookâs handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts youâre tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. Theyâll still be visible on the News Feed while theyâre fresh, but wonât be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 7/9 Clean up your apps You can view a list of all of the apps youâve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. Itâs worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. If you donât want to log into websites and apps with your facebook account, scroll down and turn Platform off. 8/9 Change your ad preferences You can view a list of everything Facebook thinks youâre into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts. A lot more information is displayed on the desktop site than the app, so weâd recommend doing this on a computer. 9/9 Download your data Facebook lets you download all of the data it has on you, including the posts youâve shared, your messages and photos, ads youâve clicked on and even the IP addresses that are logged when you log in or out of the site.

Facebook has now replied, on a letter dated 26 March, in which it says that it will send either Mike Schroepfer, Facebookâs chief technology officer, or Chris Cox, its chief product officer. Both have worked under Mark Zuckerberg for more than 10 years, and are among the longest serving executives at the company. It did not say why the Facebook boss himself could not appear. Mr Zuckerberg has been repeatedly criticised for his failure to speak publicly about the allegations of data abuse made in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The reply letter to Damian Collins came from Rebecca Stimson, Facebookâs head of public policy in the UK. It said that Facebook took the request from parliament seriously. âFacebook fully recognises the level of public and parliamentary interest in these issues, and supports your belief that these issues must be addressed at the most senior levels of the company by those in an authoritative position to answer your questions,â it read. âAs such Mr Zuckerberg has personally asked one of his deputies to make themselves available to give evidence to the Committee.â The letter also claimed that only 1 per cent of downloads of thisisyourdigitallife â the app that Cambridge Analytica used to harvest data about users without their knowledge â had come from the UK. Damian Collins said that the DCMS committee will be âvery happy to hear from Mr Cox to give evidenceâ, but that he still wanted to speak to Zuckerberg. He said that it wasnât clear from the letter âwhether he is available as wellâ, and suggested that parliament would consider setting up a âvideo link if that is more convenient for himâ. Mr Collins also suggested that it still expected Mr Zuckerberg to come if he couldnât convincingly say why he shouldnât. âHe stated in interviews that if he is the right person to appear, he will appear,â he said. âWe think he is the right person and look forward to hearing from him.â Mr Collinsâs original letter, sent last week, accused Facebook of having âconsistently understatedâ the risks of abuse of data by the company, and that they had been âmisleading to the Committeeâ. âIt is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process,â he said. He then addressed Mr Zuckerberg directly: âGiven your commitment at the start of the New Year to âfixingâ Facebook, I hope that this representative will be you.â"}

Executives from Cambridge Analytica spoke to undercover reporters from Channel 4 News about the dark arts used by the company to help clients, which included entrapping rival candidates in fake bribery stings and hiring prostitutes to seduce them. In one exchange, the company chief executive, Alexander Nix, is recorded telling reporters: âIt sounds a dreadful thing to say, but these are things that donât necessarily need to be true as long as theyâre believed.â The Channel 4 News investigation, broadcast on Monday, comes two days after the Observer reported Cambridge Analytica had unauthorised access to tens of millions of Facebook profiles in one of the social media companyâs biggest data breaches. Profile Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica Nix worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the companyâs elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCLâs projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary â featuring on Wiredâs list of â25 Geniuses who are creating the future of businessâ â and derided as a snake oil salesman. Controversies Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trumpâs election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK â by the Electoral Commission, into the firmâs possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissionerâs Office, into data analytics for political purposes â and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Muellerâs probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giantâs biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Emma Graham-Harrison Photograph: The Washington Post Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The company, and Nix, are under pressure from politicians in the US and the UK to explain how it handled the data and what role the information played in its campaigns, if any. Play Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham criticised Cambridge Analytica for being âunco-operativeâ with her investigation as she confirmed that her watchdog would apply for a warrant to help her examine the firmâs activities. Cambridge Analytica has sold itself as the ultimate hi-tech consultant, winning votes by using data to pinpoint target groups and design messages that will appeal powerfully to their interests, although it denies using Facebook information in its work. But in the undercover investigation by Channel 4 News, in association with the Observer, executives claimed to offer a much darker range of services. In a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques. But Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients. When the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation. âOh, we do a lot more than that,â he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. âDeep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal thatâs too good to be true and make sure that thatâs video recorded. âYou know these sort of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption.â Nix suggested one possible scenario, in which the managing director of Cambridge Analyticaâs political division, Mark Turnbull, would pose as a wealthy developer looking to exchange campaign finance for land. âIâm a master of disguise,â Turnbull said. Another option, Nix suggested, would be to create a sex scandal. âSend some girls around to the candidateâs house, we have lots of history of things,â he told the reporter. âWe could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what Iâm saying.â He said these were hypothetical scenarios, but suggested his ideas were based on precedent. âPlease donât pay too much attention to what Iâm saying, because Iâm just giving you examples of what can be done, what has been done.â Any work may have stayed out of the spotlight partly because Cambridge Analytica works hard to cover traces of its operations, Nix said, using a shifting network of names and front groups. âWeâre used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you,â Nix told the source in a first phone call. Cambridge Analytica sometimes contracts under a different name, so that there are no records of its involvement, Turnbull said. That does not only protect the company, but also makes its work more efficient, he is recorded saying. âIt has to happen without anyone thinking itâs propaganda, because the moment you think âthatâs propagandaâ the next question is: âWhoâs put that out?ââ He added: âIt may be that we have to contract under a different name ... a different entity, with a different name, so that no record exists with our name attached to this at all.â In a recent project in eastern Europe, the company sent a team but âno one even knew they were there, they were just ghosted in, did the work, ghosted outâ, Turnbull said. Covers include the setting up of fake academic projects, sometimes simply going in on tourist visas, as former employees have told the Guardian they did for US elections â apparently employed in violation of Federal law. Nix also offered details regarding the services of professional ex-spies from Britain and Israel. âWe have two projects at the moment, which involve doing deep deep depth research on the opposition and providing source ... really damaging source material, that we can decide how to deploy in the course of the campaign.â Denham told Channel 4 News that she had issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica earlier this month. They were given until 6pm on Monday to respond to it, but she said the company had been âunco-operativeâ with the investigation and that she would be applying to the courts on Tuesday for a warrant. âWe need to get in there. We need to look at the databases. We need to look at the servers and understand how data was processed or deleted by Cambridge Analytica. There are a lot of conflicting stories about the data,â she said. It accused Channel 4 of setting out to entrap staff by initiating a conversation about unethical practices. It rejected any suggestion that the company used fake news, honey traps, bribes or entrapment. It said: âWe entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Anlytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes or so-called âhoney-trapsâ for any purpose whatsoever â¦ Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.â Of the suggestions they used honey trap techniques, the company said: âOur executives humoured these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to further disclose his intentions.â In a later statement Cambridge Analytica accused Channel 4 News of attempting to entrap its executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices, which it insisted the company did not use. Admitting he misjudged the situation, Nix said: âIn playing along with this line of conversation â¦ we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks â¦ I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff. I should have recognised where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner.â On Saturday, Cambridge Analytica denied it had done anything wrong in relation to the handling of Facebook data. âCambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations,â it said.

Investigations by the Observer and New York Times papers claim details from 50 million profiles have been accumulated without the users’ knowledge. The organization, Cambridge Analytica, was suspended from Facebook on Friday. Both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica deny any wrongdoing. The American data analysis firm – which isn’t linked to the famous British university – is well-known for the role it played in President Trump’s election campaign, where it provided intricate data on the thoughts of American voters. Allegations against it centre on a professor from the University of Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan, who made a personality testing Facebook app called thisisyourdigitallife. The app was a private enterprise, rather than part of his university work. The app, made in November 2013 for the Facebook platform, requested users for permission to get their profile information – and also that of their friends’. It’s alleged that Mr Kogan then sold that info on to Cambridge Analytica, in violation of Facebook’s policies. A whistleblower who worked at Cambridge Analytica talked to The Guardian, claiming he worked with Mr Kogan “to harvest millions of people’s profiles.” “We exploited Facebook… and built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on,” he said. Donald Trump campaign data company accused of harvesting Facebook data was last modified: March 18th, 2018 by ABBStaff-Jide"}

But the data came from someone who didnât hack the system: a professor who originally told Facebook he wanted it for academic purposes. He set up a personality quiz using tools that let people log in with their Facebook accounts, then asked them to sign over access to their friend lists and likes before using the app. The 270,000 users of that app and their friend networks opened up private data on 50 million people, according to the New York Times. All of that was allowed under Facebookâs rules, until the professor handed the information off to a third party. Facebook said it found out about Cambridge Analyticaâs access in 2015, after which it had the firm certify that it deleted the data. On Friday, Facebook said it now knows Cambridge actually kept it — an infraction that got Cambridge suspended from the social network. Once that was announced, executives quickly moved on to defending Facebookâs security. âThis was unequivocally not a data breach,ââ longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth said on Twitter. âPeople chose to share their data with third-party apps and if those third-party apps did not follow the agreements with us/users it is a violation.ââ Alex Stamos, Facebookâs head of security, echoed the same arguments. Cambridge denied doing anything illegal or using the information in the 2016 presidential election; Facebook says it has no way of knowing how or whether the data was used for targeting in the Trump campaign. Facebookâs advertising business depends on users sharing their most personal data via its social network. But the companyâs ânot a breachâ argument isnât likely to make users feel any safer or more comfortable doing so — especially given that itâs already under fire for missing that Russian actors were purchasing U.S. election ads on the site to sway voter opinions,Â as well as running fake accounts disguised as real Americans. The company has also been fending off accusations that itâs too slow to notice or react to harmful content. U.K. Inquiry The latest incident has raised new questions about what technical guardrails Facebook has in place to prevent authorized users from sharing sensitive information, and how much visibility the company has into how outsiders use the data. Facebook wouldnât comment on those questions, saying only that it has made significant improvements in its ability to âdetect and prevent violationsâ by app developers, such as random audits of applications using its tools to make sure theyâre following the rules. And itâs no longer letting developers who use Facebookâs login tools see information on their usersâ friends. In London, the head of a parliamentary committee said he will ask Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to send a senior executive to testify as part of its inquiry into fake news. Damien Collins, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said itâs not acceptable for companies to send witnesses who avoid responding to questions âby claiming not to know the answers.â The disclosure of Facebookâs actions also underscores itâs continuing struggle to anticipate negative consequences of its lack of oversight â in some cases taking action only after things go wrong. The company in the past two years has worked to understand and counteract the spread of misinformation on its site, the use of its automated advertising system for racist targeting, the proliferation of fake user accounts, the spread of violent video, and more. But when the company tries to explain what itâs doing, it grapples with the perception that itâs shirking responsibility for its problems, treating them as public-relations snafus instead of serious product flaws. Stamos, the Facebook security executive, deleted his original tweets on Cambridge Analytica, saying he wasnât so good at âtalking about these things in the reality of 2018.â Specifically, he said he didnât know how to balance his personal beliefs with his responsibility to Facebook and his co-workers, amid all the criticism. âWe have collectively been too optimistic about what we build and our impact on the world,â Stamos wrote Saturday on Twitter. âBelieve it or not, a lot of the people at these companies, from the interns to the CEOs, agree.â"}

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) TOKYO (AP) â Asian shares skidded Tuesday following an overnight decline on Wall Street after Facebook reported its worst loss in four years. Investors are awaiting the first Federal Reserve meeting under the new chairman, Jerome Powell, and anticipating the first rate increase of the year. FACEBOOK DROP: The technology rout on Wall Street on Monday was set off by Facebook's worst loss in four years. The social media giant's plunge followed reports that Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm working for President Donald Trump's campaign, improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users without their permission. Legislators in the U.S. and Europe criticized Facebook, and investors are wondering if companies like Facebook and Alphabet will face tighter regulation. WALL STREET: The S&P 500 index sank 1.4 percent to 2,712.92. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.3 percent to 24,610.91. The Nasdaq composite gave up 1.8 percent to 7,344.24 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks declined 1 percent to 1,570.56. FEDERAL RESERVE: The U.S. Federal Reserve's first meeting under Jerome Powell's leadership ends later this week, likely with an announcement that the Fed will resume modest interest rate hikes. A healthy U.S. job market and a relatively steady economy have given the Fed the confidence to think the economy can withstand further increases. And the financial markets have been edgy for weeks.

The money was invested through Yuri Milner, a Russian-American billionaire tech investor who is also an investor in a start-up venture helmed by Jared Kushner. Milner sold his holdings in both companies years ago and has no apparent connection to Russia's propaganda campaign that took place during the 2016 election. Still, the revelations bear significance because, as one expert put it, \"Kremlin-connected institutions make investments with strategic interests in mind.\" Newly-leaked documents show that the Kremlin invested hundreds of millions of dollars into Twitter and Facebook through the Russian-American billionaire tech investor, Yuri Milner. According to the \"Paradise Papers\" - a trove of more than 13 million internal documents released Sunday that show how the world's wealthiest use offshore tax havens - two Russian state-owned entities with close ties to Vladimir Putin invested money into Facebook and Twitter through Milner. Milner also currently holds a stake in a real-estate project that was founded and is partially owned by Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law. When Kushner first joined the Trump administration, he failed to disclose his holdings in the project. Russia's state-owned VTB Bank gave Milner $191 million to invest in Twitter, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which obtained the Paradise Papers. The bank, according to The New York Times, frequently embarks on \"politically strategic deals.\" Documents also show that Gazprom Investholding, the financial arm of the Russian state-operated energy firm Gazprom, backed a company affiliated with Milner which owned approximately $1 billion in Facebook stock shortly before it went public in 2012. Gazprom is one of Russia's largest energy companies and Putin is said to wield significant influence over the firm, which is stacked with the Russian leader's allies and associates. When all was said and done, Milner owned roughly 8% of Facebook and 5% of Twitter, according to The Times. He sold his holdings in both social-media companies years ago, and there is no evidence that he was connected to Russia's widespread propaganda campaign on the two platforms during the 2016 election. He also told the ICIJ that he was not aware of Gazprom Investholding's involvement in his investments, and that none of his deals were related to politics. Commercial interests and state interest 'go hand in hand' for Russia Mikhail Klimentyev/Pool Photo via AP, File Vladimir Putin. Despite that, revelations that two major Russian state-owned entities pursued financial interests in Facebook and Twitter do bear some significance. \"Kremlin-connected institutions make investments with strategic interests in mind - not just commercial interests but state interests as well,\" Michael Carpenter, who served as Russia director on the National Security Council during the Obama administration, told The Times on Sunday. \"They go hand in hand.\" Carpenter added that Russian oligarchs who receive financial support from Russian banks must be above a certain \"political threshold, meaning such support requires the explicit or tacit approval of those at the top of Russia's crony capitalist system.\" Facebook and Twitter have taken center stage in recent weeks, particularly after it emerged in September that Russian \"trolls\" used the platforms to organize divisive rallies and spread misinformation to sow discord among the American public leading up to the election. Last week, lawyers representing the two companies and Google testified before the House and Senate intelligence committees about Russia's election meddling. As part of their investigation into Russia's interference, congressional intelligence committees and the FBI are also looking into whether the Russians had help from any members of the Trump campaign. Brad Parscale, who served as the campaign's digital director, testified before the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session in late October. Kushner, who managed the campaign's data operation along with Parscale, is also a subject of interest to the committees and to special counsel Robert Mueller. Editor's Note: A previous version of this article described Mr. Milner as a business associate of Mr. Kushner. Milner is an investor in Kushner's start-up venture, Cadre."}

From Facebook's description of the program: With Partner Categories you can target people based on offline behaviors people take outside of Facebook, such as owning a home, being in the market for a new truck or being a loyal purchaser of a specific brand or product. Facebook's Partner Categories offering was the result of a slew of data partnerships with companies such as Axiom and Oracle. These companies pull data from surveys, public records and store loyalty cards, among others. This kind of ad targeting was useful, but doesn't make up the bulk of Facebook's ad business While Partner Categories was useful to some brands, the majority of Facebook's advertisers' either employ Facebook's rich set of data on its users or their own data for ad targeting, according to ad buyers. Both of those targeting options are still available. Generally speaking, Partner Categories appealed to big advertisers that don't have their own consumer data - like say packaged goods advertisers that primarily sell their products in stores, or car brands that sell via dealers. Conversely, brands that sell directly to consumers - companies along the lines of Dollar Shave Club, Casper and Warby Parker - are less likely to need third-party data to run ad campaigns, since they collect their own data from their customers. Also, it's important to note that while Facebook is taking away the option of using third-party data to target people with ads, marketers will still be able to use data from the Oracles of the world to measure the impact of campaigns. In other words, a toothpaste brand will no longer be able to use third-party data to send ads to people who are frequent supermarket shoppers. But they will still be able to use data from these third parties to track whether ads on Facebook resulted in people buying their products in stores. So this move is unlikely to cause Facebook's revenue to plunge overnight. But it could potentially frustrate many big advertisers, many of which are wrestling with how effective Facebook advertising is in the first place. Facebook is embracing data populism But Facebook clearly wants to be more conservative with its data. Or at least it wants to look like it is, as pressure mounts on the company to disclose what happened with Cambridge Analytica and the 2016 election. \"We want to let advertisers know that we will be shutting down Partner Categories,\" said Facebook product marketing director Graham Mudd in a statement. \"This product enables third party data providers to offer their targeting directly on Facebook. While this is common industry practice, we believe this step, winding down over the next six months, will help improve people's privacy on Facebook.\""}

An extended investigation by the Guardian in the UK has revealed the extraordinary amount of information trawled by the firm and its collaborators in both countries. …in 2014, 50 million Facebook profiles were harvested by a UK-based academic, Aleksandre Kogan, and his company Global Science Research. Kogan assembled the information through an app on the site â it collected details of Americans who were paid to take a personality test, but also gathered data on those peopleâs Facebook friends. Kogan had a deal to share this information with Cambridge Analytica. But according to a whistleblower, Christopher Wylie, most of this personal information had been taken without authorisation. He said Cambridge Analytica used it to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Wylie, a Canadian who previously worked for Cambridge Analytica, has lifted the lid on this and other practices at the firm, which he describes as a âfull-service propaganda machineâ On the business background of the publicity-adverse company, the newspaper notes that: Robert Mercer, a key Trump supporter and donor, gave $15m in funding to Cambridge Analytica. Mercer, who also funded the rightwing website Breitbart, was introduced to the firm by Steve Bannon. Bannon, who was on its board from 2014 to 2016, headed the last phase of Trumpâs election campaign and then served as his chief strategist. The company worked on three candidatesâ campaigns for the presidency, including Trumpâs. On its website it describes analysing millions of data points to identify the most persuadable voters and the issues they cared about and then sending them messages to âmove them to actionâ. Voters in 17 states were polled every day, and online advertising and social media used to send them messages. The company claims that in this way it boosted donations and turn out and contributed to Trumpâs victory.

On Saturday morning, Facebook dove into the semantics of its disclosure, arguing against wording in the New York Times story the company was attempting to get out in front of that referred to the incident as a breach. Most of this happened on the Twitter account of Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos before Stamos took down his tweets and the gist of the conversation made its way into an update to Facebookâs official post. âPeople knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,â the added language argued. I have deleted my Tweets on Cambridge Analytica, not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in. While the language is up for debate, lawmakers donât appear to be looking kindly on Facebookâs arguably legitimate effort to sidestep data breach notification laws that, were this a proper hack, could have required the company to disclose that it lost track of the data of 50 million users, only 270,000 of which consented to data sharing to the third party app involved. (In April of 2015, Facebook changed its policy, shutting down the API that shared friends data with third-party Facebook apps that they did not consent to sharing in the first place.) While most lawmakers and politicians havenât crafted formal statements yet (expect a landslide of those on Monday), a few are weighing in. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar calling for Facebookâs chief executive â and not just its counsel â to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee. Facebook breach: This is a major breach that must be investigated. Itâs clear these platforms canât police themselves. I’ve called for more transparency & accountability for online political ads. They say âtrust us.â Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary. Senator Mark Warner, a prominent figure in techâs role in enabling Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, used the incident to call attention to a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Honest Ads Act, designed to âprevent foreign interference in future elections and improve the transparency of online political advertisements.â âThis is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West,â Warner said in a statement. âWhether itâs allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, itâs clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.â That call for transparency was echoed Saturday by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey who announced that her office would be launching an investigation into the situation. âMassachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,âÂ Healey tweeted. TechCrunch has reached out to Healeyâs office for additional information. On Cambridge Analyticaâs side, it looks possible that the company may have violated Federal Election Commission laws forbidding foreign participation in domestic U.S. elections. The FEC enforces a âbroad prohibition on foreign national activity in connection with elections in the United States.â âNow is a time of reckoning for all tech and internet companies to truly consider their impact on democracies worldwide,â said Nuala OâConnor, President of the Center for Democracy & Technology. âInternet users in the U.S. are left incredibly vulnerable to this sort of abuse because of the lack of comprehensive data protection and privacy laws, which leaves this data unprotected.â Just what lawmakers intend to do about big techâs latest privacy debacle will be more clear come Monday, but the chorus calling for regulation is likely to grow louder from here on out."}

Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends’ data.â Later in the same post, Zuckerberg claims that the issue surfaced again in 2015 and Facebook took action (perhaps not enough action) to bring the offending company into compliance with Facebook policies. What Facebook Data Did They Get? The full answer to this question will come out in the upcoming investigations and legal proceedings. But we can make a pretty good guess at what data Cambridge Analytica obtained by looking at the endpoints of Facebookâs Graph API v1.0 (application programming interface) which launched April 21, 2010, and wasnât fully closed down until April 30, 2015. Using Facebookâs Graph API v1.0, developers had unfettered access to almost all of your public-facing profile data, including: The heart of the scandal focuses on one of the APIâs permissions groups called âExtended Profile Properties.â These endpoints provided access to data about your friends that your friends may not have explicitly granted permission for Facebook to expose, specifically: In another permissions group, the API exposed an endpoint called read_mailbox which, just as it sounds, allowed developers access to usersâ private messages. Wow, Thatâs a Lot of Data. What Can You Do with It? With tens of millions of rich data profiles, you can apply the tools of data scientific research to turn the data into action. This usually follows a disciplined methodology that starts with transforming the data into usable cohorts and clusters, learning about the propensities of the different cohorts and clusters, and then predicting how they might react to messaging by using simulations (Will a $10 discount work better than a coupon for a 10 percent discount? Is this cohort likely to vote for X?). Optimization is another common use for data (Letâs optimize our media buy to drive 5 percent higher conversions by doing X. Letâs get more people to vote for X). None of this is new. None of this is news. This is how internet advertising works. Wait. What? As insane as this may sound, all of the sensationalist craziness, the ~$50 billion of Facebook value wiped out by the scandal, and all the talk of espionage and intrigue are basically about the realization that your data is used to serve you highly relevant, hyper-targeted messages. Again: Not new. Not news. If Cambridge Analytica didnât obtain this data set from Facebook, it could have simply purchased a bunch of data and used best practices mar-tech tools to accomplish its marketing goals. Not surprisingly, a fair number of digital marketers Iâve spoken to about this believe that Cambridge Analytica would have achieved better results by leveraging the platforms directly. Why Do I Care about This? The silver lining to the FacebookâCambridge Analytica scandal is the fact that you are becoming aware of what data you create, what is collected, and how it is used. This is a very good thing. When Facebook urges you to configure your privacy settings, they are using the wrong words. The company should be advising you that you are actually configuring your âPublic Persona Settingsâ or your âOnline Presence Settingsâ or simply your âPublic Settings.â Whom you share your stuff with and who gets to see it are practically meaningless in the context of this issue. What you should be configuring is your âPersonal Data Sharing Permission Settingsâ or âAPI Endpoint Permissions.â These settings would restrict the data that could be extracted while we are passively going about our business online. Way Too Complicated! No. It really isnât. As a society, we have to raise our level of data maturity. Clearly Facebook has grown faster than it has matured. Societally, we are all neophytes when it comes to data literacy and data governance. If you want control of your data, it would be a great idea to understand what that means. âThey know everything about me,â says someone scared out of their wits by sensationalist headlines. No. They donât. They have data that can be turned into action to enrich organizations smart enough to use it. Are you hurt by this? Could you be? Right now, you get to use Facebook, Google, Gmail, Waze, and other âfreeâ apps for the cost of your data. If you donât want to pay with your data, you are welcome to make other choices. But you should understand how your data is being used before making a blanket statement that your data should be 100 percent private and 100 percent protected. Data is a form of currency, and it is a valid way to pay for goods and services. Data can be (and is) transformed into cash by tech companies. But that does not diminish the value of the services they provide. Just because you did not take the time to learn how you were paying for a tech service and you thought it was âfreeâ doesnât mean it is actually free and, most importantly, that you would be willing to pay cash money for it. So letâs use this scandal as an opportunity to learn as much as we can about data so when we start the regulatory process, we do it in a responsible way.

We wanted to understand how much awareness there has been of this incident and what behaviors and attitudes may have changed among those who are aware. To that end, we commissioned a survey of 1,153 random U.S. adults (not just DuckDuckGo users), who collectively are demographically similar to the general population of U.S. adults. Surveys were taken on Mar 26th and 27th, 2018. Here are the results. Awareness We found that 85.34% +/- 2.04% of U.S. adults are aware of the Cambridge Analytica incident. Deleting Facebook Accounts Among those who are aware and who currently have a Facebook account, 37.00% +/- 3.39% state that they're now more likely to delete their Facebook account. Sharing Less Personal Information with Facebook Similarly, among those who are aware and who currently have a Facebook account, 60.82% +/- 3.42% plan to share less personal information with Facebook. Trust in Facebook More than half (56.00% +/- 3.10%) of those who are aware of the incident disagree with the statement, \"I trust Facebook to take appropriate action to protect it's users' online privacy.\" Regulation of Facebook 42.58% +/- 3.09% of respondents who are aware of the Cambridge data incident agree with the statement, \"I believe the government should play a greater role in regulating how Facebook handles user data.\" Add to them the 21.44% +/- 2.56% who are neutral, and a solid majority (64.02% +/- 3.00%) are not opposed to the regulation of Facebook. These responses differ significantly from those who haven't heard of the incident. 42.58% +/- 3.09% of those that have heard of the incident responded that they somewhat agree, agree, or strongly agree with the statement above. Compared with 30.18% +/- 6.92% of those who haven't heard about the incident, the relative change between those groups is 41.10% +/- 25.11%. Concern for Online Privacy Moving beyond Facebook, among those who are aware of the incident, 64.23% +/- 2.99% responded that they're now more concerned for their online privacy as a result of the event. Seeking Tools/Services to Protect Online Privacy Roughly half (51.12% +/- 3.12%) of those polled who are aware of the Cambridge Analytica incident are now more likely to seek out tools and services to protect their online privacy. Even if you delete your Facebook account or stop visiting the website entirely, trackers from Facebook still lurk on about 25% of websites. Facebook can still use this tracking to create a \"shadow\" profile about you, and target ads at you via their audience ad network off of Facebook, or if you still use Facebook somewhat, use the browsing history they see to target ads at you on their site. Privacy Tip: To prevent this ad targeting and additional data collection, you need to use a tracker blocker extension/app, like the one offered by us (DuckDuckGo) on all major browsers and platforms that also includes additional privacy essentials. In Summary In just a week and a half, the Cambridge Analytica incident has had a major impact on Americans' sentiment toward Facebook and online privacy. We expect continued shifts in attitudes and behaviors about Facebook and other services as coverage continues to scrutinze poor privacy practices, and the dialogue turns to what we can do about them. Methodology These results are based on the polling of a random sample of 1,153 American adults (18+) on March 26th and 27th, 2018 via SurveyMonkey's Audience platform, which ensures the demographic make-up of respondents is representative of the U.S. population. Survey respondents were paid and a confidence level of 95% was used for calculating the values above."}

Over the weekend, Android owners were displeased to discover that Facebook had been scraping their text-message and phone-call metadata, in some cases for years, an operation hidden in the fine print of a user agreement clause until Ars Technica reported. Facebook was quick to defend the practice as entirely aboveboard—small comfort to those who are beginning to realize that, because Facebook is a free service, they and their data are by necessity the products. In its current iteration, Facebook’s Messenger application requests that those who download it give it permission to access incoming and outgoing call and text logs. But, as users discovered when prompted to download a copy of their personal data before permanently deleting their Facebook accounts, a certain amount of data was covertly siphoned without explicit permissions. Buried inside those data caches was an unsettling amount of specific, detailed information—in some cases, every phone call or text message ever sent or received on their Android device. Dylan McKay, who apparently owns an Android phone, reported that for the period between November 2016 and July 2017, his archives contained “the metadata of every cellular call I’ve ever made, including time and duration” and “metadata about every text message I’ve ever received or sent.” When people like McKay agreed to share their contacts with Facebook, it appears they didn’t know the extent to which they were giving Facebook access to their personal information. Facebook responded with a blog post laying out the applicable user-agreement terms and denying that Facebook collects call or SMS data surreptitiously. “Contact uploading is optional. People are expressly asked if they want to give permission to upload their contacts from their phone—it’s explained right there in the apps when you get started,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian. “People can delete previously uploaded information at any time and can find all the information available to them in their account and activity log from our Download Your Information tool.” But the revelation couldn’t have come at a worse time for Facebook, which is trying—and failing—to dig itself out from under the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. On Sunday, the company released a full-page print advertisement in the U.K.’s The Observer,The Sunday Times,Mail on Sunday,Sunday Mirror,Sunday Express, and the Sunday Telegraph, along with American newspapers The New York Times,The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal, in an attempt to regain public trust. In the ad, Zuckerberg called the Cambridge Analytica leak a “breach of trust” and apologized, reassuring readers that “we’re now taking steps to ensure this doesn’t happen again,” but so far it seems to have missed the mark. According to a poll from SurveyMonkey and Axios published on Monday, Facebook’s already-low favorability rating has dropped twice as much as that of other tech giants from October 2017 to March 2018."}

The guidelines is thought to had been used to lend a hand Donald Trump’s 2016 marketing campaign for US president.

Tom Pahl, appearing director of the FTC’s Bureau of Client Coverage, stated it took the reviews about consumer knowledge going off target “very critically”. He stated the FTC ceaselessly took “enforcement motion” towards companies that brought about really extensive harm to shoppers via breaking regulations that govern how private data will have to be stored secure. Fb is needed via legislation to inform customers and get their permission ahead of knowledge is shared past their most well-liked privateness settings in what’s referred to as the “consent decree”. David Vladeck, the previous director of the FTC’s Bureau of Client Coverage, stated that the penalty for each and every violation of the consent decree is $40,000.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/national/ct-facebook-cambridge-analytica-20180318-story.html","title":"U.S. and British lawmakers demand answers from Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg - Chicago Tribune","text":"U.S. and European officials on Sunday called for Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to explain how personal information about tens of millions of users ended up in the hands of a data analysis firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign - without the permission or knowledge of the vast majority of those affected. News reports about Facebook's role in the aggressive form of data collection also have raised serious questions about whether the company violated a landmark consent decree with a federal watchdog agency designed to prevent privacy violations. Two former U.S. officials who negotiated the 2011 agreement between the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook say the company may have broken its promises, potentially triggering many millions of dollars in fines. \"I would not be surprised if at some point the FTC looks at this. I would expect them to,\" said David Vladeck, a former director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. In that role, he oversaw the investigation of alleged privacy violations by Facebook and the resulting consent decree. Vladeck said the law allows fines up to $40,000 per violation. With a reported 50 million people affected, he said, the \"maximum exposure\" could reach into the billions of dollars. It is more likely that, if the FTC found violations, Facebook would face far smaller but still substantial fines as well as other consequences. Facebook has denied violating the agreement with the FTC, which did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. But the surge of political and regulatory scrutiny over the weekend again turned a harsh spotlight on a company that has been scrambling to protect its reputation since allegations emerged about Russian agents using the social media platform in an attempt to manipulate American voters during the 2016 election season and beyond. The latest revelations concern how people working for Cambridge Analytica, which the Trump campaign paid at least $6 million to assist in its digital operations, used an app to gather research on 270,000 users in 2014 and 2015. But the number of affected people was many more - likely in the tens of millions - because the data routinely available to app developers in that era also included information on a user's list of friends, including names, education, work histories, birthdays, likes, locations, photos, relationship statuses, and religious and political affiliations. That kind of information is extremely valuable to political campaigns for tailoring messages, ads and fundraising pitches. Though both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, some of this weekend's demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either capital. \"They say 'trust us,' but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement. Rep. Adam Schiff, Calif., the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill. \"I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space,\" Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. \"There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms.\" Similar calls for official investigation came from several other U.S. lawmakers, the European Union's justice commissioner and a British lawmaker, Damian Collins, head of a parliamentary committee that has been investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. \"I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,\" Collins said Sunday. \"It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers.\" At least two state attorneys general, from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, also have announced plans to investigate. Facebook declined to comment on the requests for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts to investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica. \"We are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists,\" Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, said in the statement. \"That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information.\" Zuckerberg generally has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform has intensified. He has written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch. Facebook executives throughout the weekend also resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a \"breach\" of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially. Facebook suspended the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and two of its former employees Friday for improperly sharing the data that was collected through the app and not destroying it at Facebook's request in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data. \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,\" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday. Facebook said it also is investigating its hiring of Joseph Chancellor, who is identified in corporate documents as an official of the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and is now at the social network, focusing on virtual reality. Facebook would not say whether it was aware of Chancellor's role at Cambridge Analytica at the time of his hiring. While a Zuckerberg appearance on Capitol Hill could make compelling political theater, the possibility of renewed investigation by the FTC presents a more immediately serious problem. The consent decree the agency signed with Facebook in 2011 required that users be notified and that they explicitly give their permission before data about them is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. The developer of the app that collected data for Cambridge Analytica in 2014 sought permission from those who downloaded the app but not their Facebook friends. The app, called \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\" A key question now is what was allowed under Facebook's privacy settings at the time Cambridge Analytica's app was active, and whether those permissions were so broad that they allowed routine violations of the consent ecree with the FTC. In a 2014 news release announcing new restrictions to its developer policies, a Facebook executive wrote, \"We've heard from people that they are often surprised when a friend shares their information with an app.\" That admission may indicate that Facebook users had not been given adequate understanding of how their data and their friend's data was used by third-party developers such as Cambridge. Facebook said in a statement Saturday, \"We reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.\" The view held by Vladeck, the former FTC official who is now a Georgetown law professor, is shared by another former agency official who was closely involved in the crafting of the consent decree. Jessica Rich, who was the deputy director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection and oversaw the FTC's privacy program in 2011, led the investigation into Facebook before the consent decree. She said in an email Sunday morning that Facebook's reported action, if true, \"bespeaks the same recklessness with its users' data that prompted the FTC to take action in 2011.\" Rich, now vice president for advocacy at Consumer Reports, listed multiple conditions in the consent decree that Facebook may have breached, including those about seeking explicit permission from users before sharing their data. \"Depending on how all the facts shake out, Facebook's actions could violate any or all of these provisions, to the tune of many millions of dollars in penalties,\" Rich said. \"They could also constitute violations of both US and EU laws. Facebook can look forward to multiple investigations and potentially a whole lot of liability here.\" Facebook has long been the subject of intense criticism for its privacy and security practices. Consumer watchdog groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center often urged the FTC to investigate the company, saying that it had deceived consumers by changing the way it handled users' sensitive information with little warning. The FTC agreed in November 2011, faulting Facebook for making some information, such as users' friends lists, viewable by the public without first obtaining those users' explicit permission. The FTC also found that Facebook shared personal information with advertisers despite promising not to do so. The agency raised other issues about apps on Facebook that regulators said had access to more information than they needed to operate. As a result, the FTC required Facebook to obtain consumers' consent before \"enacting changes that override their privacy practices,\" the agency said at the time. It also subjected Facebook to 20 years of independent, third-party privacy checkups to ensure that it followed the settlement. Years later, though, the latest controversy is spurring demands for more action, with consumer advocates saying the FTC is partly to blame because it did not penalize the social media giant for other privacy mishaps. \"This is the consequence of the Federal Trade Commission's failure to enforce the 2011 consent order with Facebook,\" said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"The United States needs a dedicated privacy agency and a comprehensive privacy law. The FTC can't do the job.\" The rising clamor on Capitol Hill for answers was heavier on the Democratic side. But Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Fla., also criticized Facebook on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"Sometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think perhaps they're above the rules that apply to everybody else,\" Rubio said."}

The personal data of 50 million Facebook users was leaked to a data analytics firm and used to help Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election, it has been claimed. Cambridge Analytica used this information to build sophisticated software models in 2014 to target US voters with political advertising, according to a whistleblower who said he helped collect the data. Facebook, which denied the incident amounted to a data breach, confirmed it knew about it in 2015 but didn't inform affected individuals or data protection regulators. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie said he worked with a Cambridge University academic to collect user data via a third-party Facebook app called thisisyourdigitallife. Aleksandr Kogan created the app through his company Global Science Research (GSR) and worked with Cambridge Analytica to pay 270,000 Facebook users to take part in a personality test. They also agreed to have their data, such as their home city and Facebook 'likes', collected for academic use. But then-Analytica employee Wylie told the Observer, which broke the story, that the app also collected data belonging to Facebook friends of the users who signed up to the quiz, producing a pool of data of tens of millions of people. \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,\" Wylie told the newspaper. \"And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.\" Cambridge Analytica claimed it had deleted all the data shared by GSR when it discovered this information was collected in breach of Facebook's terms of service and had no reason to believe the data was obtained illegally. \"In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States,\" its statement read. \"No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\" On the eve of the story breaking, Facebook said it has banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform. In explaining its decision, Facebook said that while Kogan obtained people's data legitimately, by then sharing that information with Cambridge Analytica he had \"lied\" to the company and broken platform rules about not sharing such information with third-parties. Kogan maintains he acted legally and had a \"close working relationship\" with Facebook, the Guardian reports. Facebook learned of this violation in 2015 and subsequently removed the app from its platform. It also \"demanded certifications\" from Kogan, Wylie and Cambridge Analytica that they had deleted the data. However, while Wylie said he received a letter from Facebook lawyers in August 2016 to this effect, he claimed they never followed up to verify the data was deleted. \"That to me was the most astonishing thing,\" he said. \"They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.\" The social network also failed to report the leak of data to the affected users or to US state regulators, because it claimed the event was not a data breach. Facebook said: \"Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. \"If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.\" All rights reserved.

Giving evidence today, to a UK parliamentary select committeeÂ that’s investigating the use of disinformation in political campaigning, Wylie said: “The 50 million number is what the media has felt safest to report — because of the documentation that they can rely on —Â but my recollection is that it was substantially higher than that. So my own view is it was much more than 50M.” We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response. “There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallifeÂ deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014. “That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.” The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie. “This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.” Facebook has previously confirmedÂ 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it. Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing. Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reportedÂ that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform. In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak. It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes.Â EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that. “There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.” Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, FacebookÂ settled with theÂ FTC over charges it had deceived usersÂ by âtelling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made publicâ. And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal. Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election. When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data. The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data. (Following the session, CA has also now put out a longer response statement, refuting multiple parts of Wylie’s testimony and claiming he has “misrepresented himself and the company”. In this it also claims: “Cambridge Analytica does not hold any GSR data or any data derived from GSR data. We have never shared the GSR data with Aggregate IQ [another alleged affiliate company], Palantir or any other entity. Cambridge Analytica did not use any GSR data in the work that we did for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.”) Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”. “That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data. Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered. Kogan also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”. Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it sought to predict via patterns in the data. He said: For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC.Â And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like. “That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.” Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later. “The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.” “All kinds of people [had] access to the data” Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms. Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA. “We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.” The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions. “That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Wylie added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.” Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.” The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns. Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used. “Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.” In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: âThe source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the companyâs intellectual property.” Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA. “It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore. “But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].” The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”. During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform. “He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted? “It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.” We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either. Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.” “I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he said. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.” “All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.” FREE BONUS SOFTWARE DOWNLOAD!** Includes Giveaway Rights ** Brought To You By Profit Agency Free Downloads Click The Image To Download Products & Reviews: The smart phone industry is booming.

Image A senator demanded that Facebookâs founder, Mark Zuckerberg, appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a British lawmaker has called for him to testify in an inquiry into the âBrexitâ referendum.CreditCreditJim Wilson/The New York Times By Jeffrey Goldfarb March 19, 2018 For a business built on growing friendships, Facebook is making an astonishing number of enemies. Revelations that some 50 million of its user profiles were inappropriately harvested add to a list of outcries over the social networkâs practices. It has come to the point where Facebookâs founder, Mark Zuckerberg, will have to prove somehow he is not in way over his head. Mr. Zuckerberg, a 33-year-old Harvard dropout, has encountered doubters every step of the way since starting Facebook in his dorm room and building it into a juggernaut valued at more than $500 billion. The hubris accumulated from the achievements is now plain to see. Mr. Zuckerberg seems either oblivious to â or incapable of assuming â the responsibilities of running an enterprise of extraordinary political, cultural and social influence. It is evident even in the companyâs lame response to the latest imbroglio. The New York Times and The Observer of London chronicled, with the help of a whistle-blower, how a political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, exploited Facebook user information. Worse, they say, Facebook knew about it and failed to alert customers. The tin-eared first lines of defense over such harrowing claims were to argue that what occurred was not technically a âdata breachâ and to belatedly suspend the firmâs account. Responses from outside Facebook were notably, and deservedly, more severe. Lawmakers in the United States called for investigations into the leaks. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, demanded that Mr. Zuckerberg appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which she sits. A Conservative British lawmaker called for him to testify in a parliamentary inquiry over Russian meddling in Britainâs referendum to leave the European Union. For over a year, Mr. Zuckerberg has been ducking such requests even as he embarked on a road trip across America last year to meet people in every state. Facebook has abjectly failed to grasp the magnitude of its problems. It took Mr. Zuckerberg almost a year to apologize for his blithe 2016 comment that fake news posted across the social network didnât influence the presidential election. In the meantime, there are mounting concerns over its online advertising power, handling of privacy matters and how much tax it pays in Europe. Ten years ago, Mr. Zuckerberg hired Sheryl Sandberg to help turn his start-up into a serious corporation. It may be time for more adult supervision.

{"originalUrl":"http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-free-services-deletefacebook-2018-3","title":"#DeleteFacebook movement is reminder no 'free' service is truly free - Business Insider","text":"You've probably heard the phrase \"There's no such thing as a free lunch.\" But how about this one: \"If you're not paying, you're not the customer — you're the product.\" It's a similar concept — ain't nothing free! — but with a slightly different spin. I heard it most recently on last week's Slate \"Political Gabfest\" podcast, where the cohost David Plotz brought it up in relation to the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal. It struck me as an especially important phrase to remember in the era of \"free\" internet services. It's easy to use services from the likes of Google and Facebook and Twitter every day, never thinking of what you're trading for those services. In the case of Facebook, it's your personal information. Just one of the many pages in Facebook's settings showing you how your data is used to make Facebook money. Facebook/Instagram/Business Insider In case you weren't already acutely aware, the information gathered about you by Facebook — your interests, your age, your location, your gender, etc. — is used to sell advertisements. Rather than you paying Facebook to use its social network, Facebook makes its money by selling ads. That's how it stays \"free\" to you and me: Facebook uses the demographic information of its over 2 billion users to sell targeted advertisements. These targeted ads can be relatively benign, like an advertisement for \"Super Mario Odyssey\" being served to someone who liked the Nintendo page on Facebook. But that user information can also be used in ways that Facebook users may not like — such as the case with Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that used the information of over 50 million Facebook users to help the Trump campaign target voters. Facebook says it discovered roughly $100,000 in ad buys from June 2015 to May 2017, representing approximately 3,000 ads connected to nearly 500 affiliated fake accounts. The ads were intended to sow discord, divide US citizens, and galvanize political extremes leading up to the November 2016 election. It may be more shocking if it weren't so logical. Facebook — and other \"free\" service companies — are in the business of using user data to make money. They aren't regulated like public utilities, and they aren't necessarily in the business of protecting your best interests. Do your interests line up with their financial goals? That is the question. It's a good question to keep in mind when considering your use of services like Facebook and Twitter in the modern era. As the \"product\" in this equation, you, the user, can opt out altogether — and without a \"product,\" perhaps companies like Facebook will more carefully address your interests as they reexamine their business models."}

Facebook is struggling to respond to growing demands from Washington to explain how the personal data of millions of its users could be exploited by a consulting firm that helped Donald Trump win the presidency. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg Last Memorial Day Weekend, I ran $359.99 of Facebook ads for NuVorce, the divorce law firm that I own. We generated more than $104,000 of revenue as a result. And that's from one weekend. Over the span of the year, we doubled NuVorce's revenue through Facebook advertising. That success was made possible by the data that Facebook collects and allows companies to use in their marketing. Currently Facebook is facing scrutiny from regulators across the globe over how users' data was shared, and with whom. I understand there are political implications here, but we also need to look at the business implications. Facebook's data and exceptionally low price point makes it possible for small companies like mine to get their message to the masses in a way that has never been possible before. For a small business, Facebook advertising is the slingshot that allows David to defeat Goliath. Historically, you paid a media outlet (newspaper, radio, TV, etc.) based on the demographics of some of their consumers being close to that of your customers. Once you paid for that access to the media's consumers, let's say $20,000 for a commercial, you had to pray that enough of them would respond to your ad and buy your product to make it worthwhile. That was a pricey gamble. Facebook's data collection on who you are, where you are and what you like is why advertising on the platform is so effective. Thanks to Facebook, the days of \"pay and pray\" are over. Now, instead of paying to get in front of your customers and a bunch of other people consuming the same media, you pay to get in front of your customer and your customer only. The cost of that kind of targeted advertising is substantially lower than the $20,000 it would cost to run a commercial, so small businesses can afford to be in the game. Just last week, my marketing firm assisted an e-commerce startup with a product rollout at a conference in Las Vegas. Toolkite, based in Provo, Utah, is a data solution platform for growing e-commerce companies. Not exactly sexy stuff. But you know who thinks e-commerce data solutions are sexy? The kind of people who go to Las Vegas to attend an e-commerce conference. So we geotargeted the conference and got 160 leads for potential customers in just four days. There are countless untapped ways Facebook ads could be implemented. If your B2B company wants to work with Abbott Laboratories, maybe try this: While your contract is being considered, in addition to a traditional thank-you to your interviewers, send more than 3,300 of their employees in Illinois a \"thank you\" ad telling them how much you'd like to work with them. You'll stand out, and it will cost you a whopping $75. Facebook data allows creative small companies to compete with established companies who can outspend them on traditional media. If this tool is taken away or limited through regulation, it will hurt small businesses like mine and countless others.

{"originalUrl":"https://www.databreachtoday.com/facebook-faces-new-uproar-call-sms-metadata-a-10740#.WrphkrZzCLA.twitter","title":"Facebook Faces New Uproar: Call and SMS Metadata","text":"Facebook is facing a new controversy after some users say they've found records of phone calls and text messages in their personal files, but claim they never granted the social networking site permission to collect the data. The findings come as Facebook is scrambling to counter perhaps one of the strongest backlashes against it in its 14-year history. The company is facing multiple privacy investigations in the U.S. and U.K. over the leak of personal information pertaining to as many as 60 million Facebook users to voter-profiling firm Cambridge Analytica (see Probes Begin as Facebook Slammed by Data Leak Blowback). Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged last week to improve privacy protections and be more transparent with users. The latest findings, however, suggest a deeper disconnect between what Facebook stores and what users expected the site to gather. The privacy uproar over Cambridge Analytica has led some users to download their Facebook archive, a rich repository of personal information the site has cataloged. Over the last several days, those archives have yielded data users have found surprising. Some archives show contact information that Facebook has collected from mobile phone address books. Other information included detailed call logs, such as to whom a call was made for how long and records of SMS messages. The information is metadata - data pertaining to other data, in this case concerning details of transmissions; but it does not include the content of those calls or communications. Permission Granted? Facebook maintains that it has always asked for permission for that kind of information, but some users say they never granted permission. The situation gained steam after a tweet last Wednesday from Dylan McKay, a software developer and student in Wellington, New Zealand. He found call logs for every chat he had with his partner's mother between 2016 and last year. McKay has created an informal survey that's so far gathered about 1,000 responses on what type of metadata people have found in their Facebook archives. McKay's tweet prompted others to dig around their Facebook archives. Emma Kennedy, a London-based author, writes on Twitter that she never granted permission for Facebook to collect the data she found. I've just looked at the data files I requested from Facebook and they had every single phone number in my contacts. They had every single social event I went to, a list of all my friends (and their birthdays) and a list of every text I've sent. \"They have plundered my phone,\" Kennedy writes in another tweet. \"They have phone numbers of people who aren't on Facebook. They have phone numbers of household names who, I'm sure, would be furious to know their phone numbers are accessible. I'm appalled.\" Only Android Affected It appears the surprise call logs are only showing up for Facebook users on Android devices. Apple has never allowed developers access to call logs or SMS data on iOS, in large part for security reasons, but it does allow access to the address book. Apple officials in Sydney did not have an immediate comment. Facebook addressed the latest controversy in a blog post on Sunday. The logging of calls and text history has been an opt-in feature in Messenger since 2015 and in Facebook Lite. Facebook Lite was launched in 2015. It's aimed at developing markets and uses less data than the full-fledged app. The company only made it available last week to users in the U.S., Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland and New Zealand. Suspicion Centers on Android Messenger App It doesn't appear that the people who are complaining that their contacts have been uploaded to Facebook and calls logged would have been able to use Facebook Lite. Hence by process of elimination, that appears to make Facebook's Messenger app the culprit. Facebook asserts that users have always been asked for their permission. Aside from other technical explanations that have yet to emerge, that means if Facebook's characterization is accurate, forgetful memories may have fueled an unjustified outcry. However, the publication Ars Technica suggests a different possible scenario, rooted in Android's historical permissions settings, may have occurred. The Google-developed Android operating system allows users to give permissions to apps for certain functions. When someone downloads an app, the app asks if it is allowed to access certain data or functionality, such as a phone's camera or microphone, contacts or other information. Over the years, as some apps became more aggressive or deceptive and security concerns emerged, Android began offering more fine-grained access permissions. But in versions of Android 4.1 and prior, granting access to a phone's contacts list also granted access to call and message logs by default, Ars reports. That means that Facebook - when asking for contacts information - could have also received the call and SMS metadata. The permission structure, however, was changed in version 16 of the Android API. But Ars Technica reports that Android apps could get around the change by writing to the old version of the API. The old version of the API, 4.0, was only deprecated in Android last October, it adds. When asked about the Ars Technica report, Facebook maintains that it has always asked for permission to log call and text history even if Android did not. The company provided screen shots of the current advisories that are displayed by Android after Messenger is installed. These are the current advisories displayed by Android after someone installs Facebook's Messenger. While the Android advisory windows do describe some of the behaviors that Messenger would be allowed to do with contacts, calls and SMS messages, it doesn't state that the data will be stored on Facebook's servers. However, Facebook is more direct in its advisory. The feature is headlined \"Text anyone in your phone\" and then says it will \"continuously upload info about your contacts like phone numbers and nicknames, and your call and text history.\" Facebook's disclosure in Messenger Questions Remain ISMG asked Facebook if Ars Technica's theory is the reason for why users are surprised, and also asked if Facebook could clarify how it asked for permissions for past versions of the full Facebook mobile app and Messenger, but it did not receive a reply. Asking for access to a mobile phone's address book is common among app developers because it is used to match a new user with other people they know and who use the same app. The key in this situation, however, is whether Facebook has been clear enough with users over how much data it has been collecting. In its blog post, Facebook says it does not share call or SMS metadata with third parties. It is possible for users to delete contacts data the social network has collected. Also, in Messenger, users can turn off a menu item that continuously uploads new contact information to the company. Facebook also says it is possible to turn off the setting that syncs a person's call and text history. But the instruction included in the blog post is specific only to Facebook Lite.

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2 Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still donât know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we wonât until Facebook comes clean and notifies users. Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach. Cambridge Analyticaâs CEO called the data the âsecret sauceâ that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics â including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5 For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the companyâs poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebookâs settlement.6 Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are â or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data. We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone â including the Trump campaign â who might potentially use this data from Facebookâs platform."}

The company started hiring new lobbyists last fall after revelations Russians exploited its platform to help elect President Donald Trump. Facebook Inc. is on a hiring spree in Washington as the social network bulks up its ranks of lobbyists in the midst of a privacy scandal that cuts to the heart of its business model. As a chorus of calls mounts for answers about its data practices, Facebook is looking to hire at least 11 people for policy-related positions in Washington, according to its website. The company started hiring new lobbyists last fall after revelations Russians exploited its platform to help elect President Donald Trump. On Monday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley became the latest lawmaker to call for Facebookâs CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of confirming itâs investigating Facebookâs privacy policies following revelations about Cambridge Analyticaâs use of its data. The National Association of Attorneys General also wants to hear from Zuckerberg. The calls for Zuckerberg to testify in Washington grew louder after a series of briefings by lower company executives last week left senior lawmakers dissatisfied. Commerce Chairman John Thune, Mark Warner, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also called on Zuckerberg to appear. Zuckerberg Invitation Zuckerberg last week suggested heâd be willing to come and answer questions if he determines he is the right person to appear. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, sent an invitation Monday asking Zuckerberg to answer questions at an April 10 hearing. He also invited Google Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey to appear before his panel to discuss data privacy. Facebook hasnât answered Grassley yet. But the company is struggling to stave off a barrage of criticism that it hasnât done enough to address revelations that Cambridge Analytica, which worked with Trumpâs campaign, siphoned data from some 50 million Facebook users as it built an election-consulting company that boasted it could sway voters in contests all over the world. Facebook has lost about $73 billion in market value in the past six trading days. Since March 16, the stock has fallen 14 percent and is on track for its worst month in four years. The shares rebounded from earlier losses to end up 0.4 percent at $160.06 Monday. Last week, Facebook officials appeared unprepared and uncertain during briefings with congressional staff to answer questions about how big the problem is, according to staffers who attended the meetings. Multiple Briefings Company executives told the aides in multiple briefings that they didnât know how many copies of user data similar to that obtained by Cambridge Analytica have been made, how widely disseminated those duplicates might be and who has that information, said the staffers, who asked not to be identified because the briefings werenât public. The key issue raised in the briefings was whether there might be others that had access to the data that Cambridge Analytica obtained beginning in 2014 after entering into a commercial venture with a firm called Global Science Research, which initially got a smaller amount of user data under the guise of academic research. Zuckerberg echoed in a round of interviews last week that the company was looking into the scope of the problem and didnât yet know what it would find. He added that Facebook has a responsibility to make sure it can secure the data. Tracking System In the briefings, the Facebook officials acknowledged the company doesnât have a system to track whether a user that had promised to delete profile information had actually duplicated it and said thereâs no follow-up procedure or enforcement mechanism to lock down the data. Congressional staffers came away from the briefings doubting that the company could provide a full accounting of who might have access to the data. Facebook wouldnât disclose the names of the company officials that carried out the briefings, which were with staffers of the House Energy and Commerce, the Judiciary and Intelligence committee, and the Senate Commerce committee. Staffers also asked the Facebook officials questions about who owns data on the social network and about the policies, procedures and terms of service now in effect and what Facebook will do next. Policy Hires Among the hires Facebook is seeking to make are privacy and public policy managers, a government outreach manager, associate general counsel positions, and a couple of policy managers to help draft positions on tech and video policy issues. Some of the postings say the positions could be based in either Washington or the companyâs Menlo Park, California headquarters. It wasnât clear when the jobs were posted or whether they are new positions. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on the policy positions the company is currently trying to fill. The company ranks third among top tech companies in Washington lobbying spending after Alphabet Inc.âs Google and Amazon.com Inc. and employs about 40 internal and external lobbyists. The company disclosed spending $11.5 million on lobbying in 2017, up from $8.7 million the year before. In the days last fall before Facebook officials were called in to testify on the Russian campaign meddling, the company hired three lobbyists to work on issues that included online advertising and election integrity, according to federal disclosures. Three Lobbyists The three lobbyists were David Wade, a former top aide to John Kerry during his tenures in the Senate and at the State Department; Sudafi Henry, who served as Vice President Joe Bidenâs legislative affairs director; and Luke Albee, a former chief of staff to Senator Mark Warner. They all started lobbying for Facebook in October, according to congressional filings. It wasnât clear if any of them participated in the congressional briefings last week. Albee started lobbying for the company on Oct. 30 — two days before his former boss, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, grilled Colin Stretch, the companyâs general counsel, in a hearing. Henry and Albee disclosed lobbying on a range of issues including consumer privacy, data security, online advertising and disclosure while Wade listed âcongressional investigationâ as the issue he would address for the company."}

That’s especially true for the presidential election, when candidates must reach many millions of voters. People use social media all day, and it’s one of the main ways Americans get their political information. And when one candidate uses a voter-targeting tactic—buying voter lists, booking local TV spots, buying crate loads of Facebook ads—others have to do it too. No candidate in a tight campaign can afford to not use every possible tool to get in front of voters. More than $1.4 billion was spent on online advertising by candidates in the 2016 election. Campaigns and super PACs supporting candidates poured money into digital ads that were fine-tuned to target specific demographics. Women in their 40s with kids who are Christian in the Midwest could receive different ads than a young male teen gamer in New York City—and they did, every time they hopped onto Twitter, Facebook, or any website that runs Google ads. Online ads are able to hit such specific subsets of people because they rely on a constellation of data collected from your browsing activity or things you like on Facebook, your location, credit card data, personal connections with friends, and other morsels of information. In theory, this corporate data collection could be subject to tighter regulation—for example, concerning the amount of time a user’s information is held. Yet, as politicians increasingly rely on data-driven advertising and microtargeting of their constituents to win elections, it’s unlikely that the U.S. will ever see meaningful privacy legislation or regulation of big internet platforms—despite many reasons to be skeptical of how they use such data, not to mention the likelihood that Facebook, Google, and others’ data-targeting tools were manipulated by Russian government–backed forces in an effort to foment divisiveness and help Trump win the election. As politicians increasingly rely on data-driven advertising and microtargeting, itâs unlikely that the U.S. will ever see meaningful privacy legislation. This is similar to the cycle of campaign finance reform. Candidates on both sides of the aisle agree campaign finance laws need to be reformed, especially since the Citizens United decision in 2010 that ruled campaign contributions were a form of “political speech.” That ruling removed limits on the amount of money corporations and wealthy donors could shell out in support of a candidate and opened the floodgates to a surge of unaccounted for money in campaigns, mostly from super PACs, which are committees that are allowed to spend as much as they want in support of a particular candidate as long as they don’t work with that politician directly. Campaign finance reform, however, is notoriously difficult to enact because once the money starts to flow into a campaign, it’s very hard to convince beneficiaries to shut the faucet. Privacy law and regulation of internet platforms are in a similar bind. The U.S. hasn’t substantially updated federal digital privacy law in 31 years, since the passage of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. The law holds, for example, that a warrant is not required to access emails stored online for more than 180 days, which means that if you keep your emails stored in webmail for years, the government can grab them without a warrant. In other words, police have to satisfy a much lower standard of reasoning to read your emails than if you printed them out and stored them in a desk drawer. The stagnation of digital privacy law isn’t due to a shortage of evidence showing online profiling can put users at risk. Advertisement Take what happened a decade ago when mortgage brokers were peddling dangerous subprime loans. During that time, financial companies were leveraging online behavior data with location and demographic data in order to deduce a person’s race. That in turn helped mortgage companies target minorities in their online marketing of bad financial products, which were sometimes referred to as “ghetto loans,” according to research from Seeta Peña Gangadharan, a professor of media and communications at the London School of Economics. Subprime lenders made the list of the top 10 spenders in online advertising in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008, according to Nielson/NetRatings data. Experian, for example spent $54 million in online advertising in 2008. The year before, in 2007, Gangadharan found Countrywide spent nearly $35 million in online advertising and Experian spent $43 million. Black wealth dropped by nearly 50 percent during the crisis, and black and Latino homeowners were about 70 percent more likely to lose their homes to foreclosure than whites. Now that there’s strong evidence that these data-targeting systems were instrumentalized in an attempt by Kremlin-backed groups to manipulate voters and spread misinformation online in the run-up to the 2016 election, one would think that this would be the opportune time to start to regulate how personal data is collected and used to target individuals in harmful ways. Looking at only six of the 470 accounts Facebook shared with Congress with alleged ties to a Kremlin-backed group that bought ads on the social network around the presidential election, Jonathan Albright, research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, found that content from that small handful of accounts alone had been shared about 340 million times. Journalists have also found that both Facebook and Google allowed ad buyers to target people based on extremely bigoted categories. ProPublica found, for example, that Facebook let advertisers target people explicitly interested in topics like “how to burn jews” or “jew hater.” Slate likewise was able to target ads on Facebook to users interested in “kill Muslimic Radicals” or “threesome rape.” BuzzFeed similarly was able to buy ads on Google targeted at the keyword phrase “blacks ruin everything” and other racist slurs. While the impacts of these corporate online ad-targeting practices in connection to the 2016 election are still being assessed, and Congress has even scheduled a public hearing to which it has invited Facebook, Google, and Twitter to testify on how their platforms were used by foreign entities to manipulate voters, it’s unlikely that any kind of meaningful regulation of these platforms or new data privacy laws will result. “The RNC and DNC have databases that have over 900 points of data on every member of the electorate,” says Daniel Kreiss, a journalism professor at the University of North Carolina. “The core of that is that public data built around commercial marketing data about things like credit card purchases and grocery card purchases and magazine subscription lists.” That information is then bundled with data about party affiliation and voter turnout to target people on websites like Facebook, Kreiss explained. There are, of course, many other reasons why Congress is unlikely to regulate online platforms beyond the fact that politicians themselves use data-driven online ads. Google is on track to be the largest corporate spender on lobbying in the U.S. this year, and executives from major tech companies are often massive donors to electoral campaigns. But still, Trump’s campaign spent $85 million on Facebook alone, according to Hong, who also wrote Trump’s Facebook posts. Republicans and Democrats alike are only poised to increase their spending on data-driven online voter targeting in future elections. And that means that no matter how pernicious the effects of microtargeting ads are, a practice that’s only possible through vast corporate data collection, the chances of Congress taking substantive action to abate those harms is slim."}

Facebook’s website had an entire section devoted to touting the “success stories” of political campaigns that usedÂ the social network to influence electoral outcomes. That page, however, is now gone, even as the 2018 congressional primaries get underway. Facebook screenshots from June 2017, left, and March 2018, right, show that the social network removed its “Government and Politics” section. Screenshots: Facebook In the wake of a public reckoning with Facebook’s unparalleled ability to distribute information and global anxiety over election meddling, bragging about the company’s ability to run highly effective influence campaigns probably doesn’t look so great. Facebook’s “success stories” pageÂ isÂ a monument to the company’s dominance of online advertising,Â providing examples from almost every imaginable industry of how use of the social network gave certain players an advantage. “Case studies like these inspire and motivate us,” the page crows. Current examples include CoverGirl (“promoting a beauty brand makeover with video ads on Facebook and Instagram”) and Tropicana (“Facebook video ads elevate fruit juice brand awareness”). Not so controversial. The case studies that Facebook used to list from political campaigns, however, included more interesting claims. Facebook’s work with Florida’s RepublicanÂ Gov. Rick Scott “used link ads and video ads to boost Hispanic voter turnout in their candidateâs successful bid for a second term, resulting in a 22% increase in Hispanic support and the majority of the Cuban vote.” Facebook’s work with the Scottish National Party, a political party in the U.K.,Â was described as “triggering a landslide.” The “success stories” drop-down menu that once included an entire section for “Government and Politics” is now gone. Pages for the individual case studies, like the Scott campaign and SNP, are still accessible through their URLs, but otherwise seem to have been delisted. Asked about the delisting, a Facebook spokesperson said that “aÂ number of the studies have been archived, but theyâre still available at the individual links.” Asked why the “Government and Politics” section had been removed entirely, the spokesperson did not reply."}

FILE PHOTO: Facebook logo is seen at a start-up companies gathering at Paris' Station F in Paris, France on January 17, 2017. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it. The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook’s reputation, which was already under attack over Russians’ alleged use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections. Facebook said the root of the problem was that researchers and Cambridge Analytica lied to it and abused its policies, but critics on Saturday threw blame at Facebook as well, demanding answers on behalf of users and calling for new regulation. Facebook insisted the data was misused but not stolen, because users gave permission, sparking a debate about what constitutes a hack that must be disclosed to customers. “The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook’s data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data. Pasquale said Facebook’s response that data had not technically been stolen seemed to obfuscate the central issue that data was apparently used in a way contrary to the expectations of users. “It amazes me that they are trying to make this about nomenclature. I guess that’s all they have left,” he said. Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner said the episode bolstered the need for new regulations about internet advertising, describing the industry as the “Wild West.” “Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said. With Republicans controlling the Senate’s majority, though, it was not clear if Klobuchar and Warner would prevail. The New York Times and London’s Observer reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, and the information has not been deleted despite Facebook’s demands beginning in 2015. Some 270,000 people allowed use of their data by a researcher, who scraped the data of all their friends as well, a move allowed by Facebook until 2015. The researcher sold the data to Cambridge, which was against Facebook rules, the newspapers said. Cambridge Analytica worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign. A Trump campaign official said, though, that it used Republican data sources, not Cambridge Analytica, for its voter information. Facebook, in a series of written statements beginning late on Friday, said its policies had been broken by Cambridge Analytica and researchers and that it was exploring legal action. Cambridge Analytica in turn said it had deleted all the data and that the company supplying it had been responsible for obtaining it. Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, hinted the company could make more changes to demonstrate it values privacy. “We must do better and will,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that “our business depends on it at every level.” Facebook said it asked for the data to be deleted in 2015 and then relied on written certifications by those involved that they had complied. Nuala O’Connor, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, an advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said Facebook was relying on the good will of decent people rather than preparing for intentional misuse. Moreover, she found it puzzling that Facebook knew about the abuse in 2015 but did not disclose it until Friday. “That’s a long time,” she said. Britain’s data protection authority and the Massachusetts attorney general on Saturday said they were launching investigations into the use of Facebook data. “It is important that the public are fully aware of how information is used and shared in modern political campaigns and the potential impact on their privacy,” UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey’s office said she wants to understand how the data was used, what policies if any were violated and what the legal implications are."}

The Massachusetts attorney general said her office was launching an investigation after the news reports. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Maura Healey said on Twitter in a post that linked to a Times report. The United Kingdom’s Information Commission also announced on Saturday they are conducting an investigation of Cambridge Analytica, which also had clients in the country. “Any criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously,” said Elizabeth Denham, Information Commissioner. Facebook on Friday said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica after finding data privacy policies had been violated. The newspapers, which cited former Cambridge Analytica employees, associates and documents, said the data breach was one of the largest in the history of Facebook Inc. The Observer said Cambridge Analytica used the data, taken without authorization in early 2014, to build a software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. It quoted whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who helped set up Cambridge Analytica and worked with an academic at Cambridge University to obtain the data, as saying the system could profile individual voters to target them with personalized political advertisements. The more than 50 million profiles represented about a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential U.S. voters, at the time, the Observer said. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer. The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it. The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said. However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising. Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.” “When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said. “We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said. He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.” Related Coverage $6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica. “Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign. He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday. On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.” Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement. “We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims. In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.” “We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said. Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements. A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election. Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population. It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups. Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015. That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system. Kogan was not immediately available for comment. The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information “in a legitimate way” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie. Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan’s app when it learned of the violation, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that “not all data was deleted.” FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is seen at the Facebook Gather conference in Brussels, Belgium January 23, 2018.

In the report by UK’s Channel 4, hidden camera footage captures Cambridge Analytica’s chief executive Alexander Nix describing some of the tricks and tools his company uses to get information about people. In addition to mining data from Facebook, Nix and the managing director of Cambridge Analyticaâs political division, Mark Turnbull, spoke of bribery stings, honey traps and spying with the help of ex-spies from Britain and Israel. âWe have two projects at the moment, which involve doing deep, deep, depth research on the opposition and providing source… really damaging source material, that we can decide how to deploy in the course of the campaign,â he told an undercover reporter posing as a Sri Lankan businessman. “We use some British companies, we use some Israeli companies,” Nix said. “From Israel, very effective in intelligence gathering.” Facebook has been under fire since The New York Times and The Guardian newspaper reported that Cambridge Analytica used data inappropriately obtained from roughly 50 million Facebook users to try to influence elections. Among that information were users’ likes. Facebook stock plunged 7 percent in trading Monday. The head of the EU parliament has promised an investigation. US congressional members and Connecticut’s attorney general are seeking testimony or written responses. After two years of failing to disclose the harvesting, Facebook said Monday that it had hired an outside firm to audit Cambridge Analytica and its activities. During the 2016 US presidential elections, Cambridge Analytica worked both for the primary campaign of Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Trump’s general-election campaign. Trump’s campaign paid Cambridge more than $6 million, according to federal election records, although officials have more recently played down that work. Cambridge Analytica was also backed by the conservative billionaire Richard Mercer, and at one point employed Stephen Bannon â later Trump’s campaign chairman and White House adviser â as a vice president. The type of data mining reportedly used by Cambridge Analytica is fairly common, but is typically used to sell diapers and other products. Netflix, for instance, provides individualized recommendations based on how a person’s viewing behaviors fit with what other customers watch. Logos of US online social media and social networking service Facebook. (AFP PHOTO / LOIC VENANCE) But that common technique can take on an ominous cast if it’s connected to possible elections meddling, said Robert Ricci, a marketing director at Blue Fountain Media. Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to “explore mental vulnerabilities of people.” He said the firm “works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs, websites etc. that make them think things are happening that may not be.” Wylie told “Today” that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters, the Cambridge Analytica effort aimed to make sure people wouldn’t know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views. The Trump campaign has denied using Cambridge Analytica’s data. The firm itself denies wrongdoing, and says it didn’t retain any of the data pulled from Facebook and didn’t use it in its 2016 campaign work. Yet Cambridge Analytica boasted of its work after Cruz won the GOP caucuses in Iowa in 2016. Cambridge Analytica helped differentiate Cruz from his similarly minded Republican rivals by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use. Even on mainstay issues such as gun rights,Â Nix said at the time, the firm used personality types to tailor its messages. For voters who care about tradition, it might push the importance of making sure grandfathers can offer family shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a pitch might describe keeping guns for protection against crime. Facebook makes it easy for advertisers to target users based on nuanced information about them. Facebook’s mapping of the “social graph” â essentially the web of people’s real-life connections â is also invaluable for marketers. For example, researchers can look at people’s clusters of friends and get good insight as to who is important and influential, said Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. People who bridge different friend networks, for example, can have more influence when they post something, making them prime for targeting. The Pew Research Center said two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media, according on Pew Research Center. While people don’t exist in a Facebook-only vacuum, it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the “rabbit hole” of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet, as Wylie described.

It's right. What really happened is much worse. On Saturday, an investigation by The New York Times, the Guardian, and its sister publication The Observer revealed that the data analytics firm that helped the Donald Trump presidential campaign had harvested the Facebook data of more than 50 million people in an effort to profile users and eventually target them with political ads. Advertisement In 2014, a researcher collected the data through an app that asked users to take a personality test for academic research purposes. Around 270,000 people agreed to have their data collected through the test, which its creator, Aleksandr Kogan, defined as âa very standard vanilla Facebook app.â But thanks to Facebookâs terms of service and its API at the time, the app was also able to collect data of their friends. This gave the researcher, who later handed the data to Cambridge Analytica, the raw information of more than 50 million people, according to the reports, which were largely based on the account of a former Cambridge Analytica data scientist. The Observer called it one of Facebookâs âbiggest ever data breaches.â The Times only referred to the incident as a âbreachâ once, using the term âleakâ throughout the rest of the article. We at Motherboard believe the use of the expression âdata breachâ in this case is incorrect and may be confusing to readers. As the news spread and echoed online, several websites and other publications called it a data breach. Manysecurityexperts and researchersâand Facebook itselfâbelieve this is the wrong expression to refer to what happened here. âIt is incorrect to call this a âbreachâ under any reasonable definition of the term,â Facebookâs chief security officer Alex Stamos wrote in a deleted tweet. Facebookâs vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal wrote that âthe claim that this is a data breach is completely false,â because the researcher who made the app obtained the data from âusers who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.â Got a tip? You can contact this reporter securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, OTR chat at lorenzo@jabber.ccc.de, or email lorenzo@motherboard.tv Advertisement Saying that âeveryone involvedâ consented seems misleading, given that only around 270,000 out of the 50 million people who got their data harvested reportedly signed up for the app. The others probably had no idea this app even existed. And since Facebook changes its privacy settings so frequently, we also don't know if the people who agreed to use the app fully understood what kind of data they were giving up. And no one at the time knew the data would later be handed out to a shadowy data analytics firm hired by the Trump campaign. While we understand why some are describing the data Kogan handed to Cambridge Analytica as a breach, based on whatâs been reported so far, we believe that describing this incident as a breach would, at least at the moment, mislead our readers. Weâve been regularly covering data breaches for years. No one hacked into Facebookâs servers exploiting a bug, like hackers did when they stole the personal data of more than 140 million people from Equifax. No one tricked Facebook users into giving away their passwords and then stole their data, like Russian hackers did when they broke into the email accounts of John Podesta and others through phishing emails. In 2014, when Kogan collected the data of 50 million people, he was playing by the rules. At the time, Facebook allowed third party apps to collect not only the data of the people who consented to giving it up, but also their friendsâ data. The company later shut down this functionality. Facebook says the data was misused because Kogan told Facebook he would use it only for academic research. But that might be the only anomalous thing about this case. Facebook obviously doesn't want the public to think it suffered a massive security breach, like Yahoo did in 2013 and 2014. We agree not because we want to minimize the significance of the Cambridge Analytica story, but because the real story is far more troubling: This data collection was par for the course. In other words, it was a feature, not a bug. And while the process that Kogan exploited is no longer allowed, Facebook still collectsâand then sellsâmassive amounts of data on its users. Advertisement As Zeynep Tufekci, the author of Twitter And Tear Gas, put it, Facebookâs vehement defense that this was not a data breach is itself actually a damning statement of whatâs wrong with Facebook, and Silicon Valleyâs ad industry in general. âIf your business is building a massive surveillance machinery, the data will eventually be used & misused,â Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies the social impact of technology, wrote on Twitter. âThere is no informed consent because it's not possible to reasonably inform or consent.â Facebookâs security team, Tufekci concluded, canât mitigate the companyâs business model, which is predicated on collecting as much of our data, and our friendâs data, as possible. We can condemn the misuse of this data, and Facebookâs data collection practices, without calling it a data breach, a term that may confuse readers and distract them from what we believe is the real problem here: Silicon Valley giants have built massive data collection machines with almost no guardrails on how they are used."}

Cambridge Analytica CEO was secretly recorded by the British Press selling his product to potential clients, saying for one, âYou never want to wage a political campaign on the issues. You want to run it on emotions. As we all know that emotions are the only thing that matter.â Â I would say that and intelligence plays a significant part also. Hillary voters didnât fall for fake fucking news stories. They were and are very discerning even when they desperately wanted to believe something. Sorry Faux âNewsâ retards, those are just the facts. Look up the 60 Minutes piece on the Trump fake news factories in Albania. Teen boys in shitty nowhere villages got rich copy/pasting fake news from Infowars and such. They are actually on camera telling Steve Croft that Trump people were the only people that they could make money off because they believe anything. And they never get any clicks (therefore no money) from the Hillary people. Them’s just facts, buttercups. Suck it up. So, emotions and intelligence. Who was targeted? Hmmm. What group was most vulnerable to a psychological attack from a foreign entity? Hmmm. Who was feeling fearful, aggrieved, angry and inferior? Hmmm. White people!. Thatâs who. Particularly uneducated, rural, southern white people in the lower quadrant of the income scale. In other words the ones who have lost the most status in recent years and understand it least as the world passes them by. They cling to the past (when just being white guaranteed you a decent living and gave you status above people of color no matter if you deserved it our not.) MLK said it best. America is was not a meritocracy then and still is not. So who was vulnerable? The scared and dumb. Damn, that turned out to be a LOT of white people. Bannon was successful in changing the culture by inflaming white peopleâs fear. Or was he really? heâs been doing the same shit for years and always been laughed off as a kook. Made fun of on late night TV when noted at all. Does he deserve any credit for changing such a monumental thing as the culture of a country? Or was he just a MF doing his thing in the corner when the spotlight just happened to find him by accident. Right place at right time. The zeitgeist, if you will. In any case, it was done. The culture is currently one of hate. Racial hatred. (Is there another kind? At its heart, itâs all tribal.) Now, will it change back? Can it be changed back? If nazism was reversed then thereâs hope for all but, damn, its going to be hard. In the end though they just donât have the numbers to maintain the hate war. Itâs just math. Thank god America, for the most part, is still a place full of striving ideals and people that hold inclusion and decency as some of the most dear of them. America is becoming California. And you know who runs Cali. Hillary beat Trumpâs ass by three million votes just there. This is a last gasp of dying white pride and all the attendant cruelty. So remember, who fell for this shit? Trumpâs rednecks, Bernieâs college educated rednecks and Steinâs commie traitors. By the definitions of the targeters, the weakest, most fearful people. Thatâs who they were looking for. Who they spent their money culling out of all the tens of millions of Facebook users (Iâd argue that just being a Facebook user makes you weak and vulnerable. But thatâs just me.

On Friday, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, Paul Grewal, said in a detailed statement that a University of Cambridge psychology professor, Aleksandr Kogan, had passed Facebook user data he gained through an app on to third-parties, including Cambridge Analytica -- a breach of the social media site's policies on protecting people's information. Grewal said in the statement that after the discovery of this violation in 2015, Facebook \"demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed.\" Despite telling the company that the data was destroyed, the Facebook statement said it recently received reports that indicated otherwise and was suspending Cambridge Analytica, its parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories, Kogan and another person he shared the information with, Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies Inc. \"We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information,\" Grewal's statement reads. \"We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\" Read More Facebook's move to suspend Cambridge Analytica came just hours before The New York Times and the British newspaper The Observer both released reports that raised questions about the handling of Facebook data by the company and its associates. In a statement, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica denied that the organization is in violation of Facebook's terms and said it is in communication with Facebook following the news it had been suspended from the platform. The spokesperson said that in 2014, Cambridge Analytica contracted with Kogan's company Global Science Research (GSR) \"to undertake a large scale research project in the United States,\" obtaining data and seeking \"the informed consent of each respondent.\" \"When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook's terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,\" the spokesperson added. \"We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook's terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted. No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\" Sen. Mark Warner called the suspension \"more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West.\" Warner, a Virginia Democrat, serves as vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. In his statement, he added: \"Whether it's allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it's clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency.\" Cambridge University acknowledged they knew of Kogan's company, Global Science Research (GSR), but said they do not believe \"he used University data or facilities for his work with GSR, and therefore that there is no reason to believe the University's data and facilities were used as the basis for GSR's subsequent work with any other party.\" \"It is important to make clear that, despite its name, Cambridge Analytica has no connection or association with the University whatsoever.\" Cambridge Analytica was hired in summer 2016 as part of the Trump campaign's three-pronged data operation. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon served as vice president and secretary of Cambridge Analytica until he stepped down to run the Trump campaign in August 2016. William A. Burck, an attorney for Bannon, said in a statement on Bannon's behalf: \"The first Mr. Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days. He has nothing to say because he knows nothing about the claims being asserted and would direct questions to Mr. Nix, who ran Cambridge Analytica the entire time Mr. Bannon was associated with it. \"We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,\" Denham's statement said. \"It's part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people's personal information to micro target voters,\" she added. CNN previously reported in October 2017 that the firm had contacted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2016 regarding thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails kept on a private server while she was secretary of state, according to four sources familiar with the outreach. Cambridge Analytica CEO Aleander Nix sent an email that said he had reached out to Assange in attempt to access emails from Clinton's private server in hopes to create a searchable database of the emails for the campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee, according to two sources. CNN reported that no one from the Trump campaign was copied on the email, the sources said. Nix sent the email in the summer of 2016, two sources said, but it is not clear whether he sent it before or after Cambridge Analytica was brought onto the campaign."}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2 Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still donât know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we wonât until Facebook comes clean and notifies users. Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach.

Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics â including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5 For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends.

The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the companyâs poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebookâs settlement.6 Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are â or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data. We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone â including the Trump campaign â who might potentially use this data from Facebookâs platform."}

To be clear: Facebook didn't have the text messages or recordings of phone calls. But it stored records of whom some people texted, and when, as well as which phone numbers they called, when, and for how long. It looks as if the party at fault here isn't Facebook directly but instead the Android operating system. Ars Technica points out that older versions of Android allowed apps to gain access to call and message logs when users actually just gave permission to read contacts. It seems Facebook thought its users had given permission to share call and text logs with it. But users may never have explicitly chosen to do that. The question now becomes how many people will see this simply as yet another Facebook privacy scandal, perhaps overlooking the nuances of deprecated Android versions and app permissions. Headlines matter for Facebook right now \"In this case, headlines matter very much for the stock,\" the analysts said in a note published March 19. \"While there will be plenty of journalists and others who can parse exactly what happened regarding this most recent issue involving Cambridge Analytica in terms of number of accounts and whether this was a 'data breach' or not, the details matter very little when looking at this through the narrow lens of an equity analyst. What matters for this stock, at this time, are the headlines.\" Facebook's skeletons are tumbling out of the closet Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images The timing of the two stories gives the impression that Facebook is dealing with a privacy scandal. It is — but the issues aren't new. Instead, they're problems the company put off dealing with. Facebook knew that Cambridge Analytica had improperly accessed its data in 2015, when a Guardian journalist revealed that the research firm had harvested data on millions of Facebook users. Facebook had already changed its app settings to stop people from handing over their friends' data, but it didn't bar Cambridge Analytica and continued to allow the company to operate on its platform. And the new Android issue was due to a version of the Android operating system that allowed Facebook to gain message and call logs from 2015 to 2017. Again, it's an old issue for Facebook that isn't ongoing, but a lack of transparency and decisive action at the time has come back to hurt the firm."}

Lawmakers in the United States and Europe are demanding to know more about the company’s privacy practices after a whistleblower said consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed data to target U.S. and British voters in close-run elections. Facebook said the company had received invitations to testify before Congress and that they were talking to legislators. Facebook shares closed down 4.9 percent on Tuesday and have fallen almost 18 percent since March 16, when Facebook first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channeled to Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The tech sector is down 5.2 percent for March and on track for its worst month since April 2016. The data breach has raised investor concerns that any failure by big tech companies to protect privacy could deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulation. House Energy and Commerce Committee spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said “The committee is continuing to work with Facebook to determine a day and time for Mr. Zuckerberg to testify”. On the same day, Zuckerberg turned down British lawmakers’ invitations to explain to a British parliamentary committee what went wrong. The company said it would instead send one of his deputies, suggesting that Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox had the expertise to answer questions on the complex subject. The head of the committee called Zuckerberg’s decision “astonishing” and urged him to think again. Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who once worked at Cambridge Analytica, said on Monday that Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed the software that used the algorithms from the Facebook data to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election. AggregateIQ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wylie’s remarks. Cambridge Analytica said it had not shared any of the Facebook profile data with AggregateIQ. Cambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in Trump’s campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules. In full-page advertisements in British and U.S. newspapers this week Zuckerberg said the app built by a university researcher “leaked Facebook data of millions of people in 2014”. He apologized last week for the mistakes the company had made and promised to restrict developers’ access to user information as part of a plan to protect privacy. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Monday it had invited Zuckerberg, as well as the CEOs of Alphabet Inc and Twitter Inc to testify at an April 10 hearing on data privacy. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and U.S. Senate Commerce Committee had already formally asked Zuckerberg to appear at a congressional hearing. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission took the unusual step of announcing on Monday that it had opened an investigation into the company - which it generally only does in cases of great public interest - citing media reports that raise what it called “substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook.”"}

We're far from the end of the saga.Â \"Technologists in general need to grapple with this. Weâre building tools that can quite clearly be used for evil or for less good. Itâs not enough to say, 'We didnât mean for them to be used this way,'\" said Daniel Mintz, chief data evangelist at software company Looker. \"We need to have a community discussion of what does ethical technology use look like and people can subscribe to them or not.\" As former Google engineer Yonatan Zunger wrote for the Boston Globe over the weekend, computer science is undergoing a \"reckoning\" and an \"ethics crisis\" not unlike what has happened in chemistry with dynamite, in physics with nuclear bombs, and in human biology with eugenics. The data scientists Mashable spoke with said they didn't see their jobs in jeopardy but did foresee future changes in the tech industry that are long overdue. But it remains to be seen who will take direct action and whether or not any of these moves are the right decision.Â Data = $$$ Bill Gates declared \"Content is King\" in an essay published to Microsoft's website back in 1996. âContent is where I expect much of the real money will be made on the Internet, just as it was in broadcasting,\" Gates wrote in the opening. But ask any internet-focused company in 2018, and the answer you'll hear will most likely be data.Â Data has become a business in itself. Founders look to find underserved areas, get as much data as they can, and therefore, become valuable. If Facebook, or another tech giant, doesn't buy a startup to keep it a standalone service or just want to acqui-hire executives, the data itself becoming a part of Facebook's empire can be reason enough. When French entrepreneur Thomas Pasquet thought about his next company in digital advertising after selling his startup, he looked at smartphones.Â \"A company that started war on mobile would be the company with the most access to data, the most comprehensive data,\" Pasquet told Mashable.Â In 2014, Pasquet started Ogury and has since collected more than 400 million mobile user profiles that helps it analyze how people use apps. For example, Ogury's data suggested that Snapchat's active user base dropped in January, with 82.7 percent of people who had it downloaded using the app at the beginning of the month and only 77 percent doing so on January 31. For an advertising agency, those consumer insights can be valuable. (Snapchat releases daily active user data on a quarterly basis, and the quarter including January has yet to be made public. However, Snapchat says it had 187 million daily active users in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year, up from 178 million in the previous quarter.) For Pasquet and Ogury, collecting more data can mean making more money. For Mintz and Looker, the overwhelming amount of data has created a business. Looker doesn't provide new data sources. Rather, Looker is a tool that visualizes existing data sets.Â \"The things that got me excited about it were not the technical side of it but what it has empowered me to do. Data is the only way to make sense of what 7 or 8 million people want to do,\" Mintz said.Â Given that idea of scale, Mintz said he doesn't see a future where data-fueled decisions and data-focused companies simply disappear. But change could come in how this information is collected and by what services.Â Trust with transparencyÂ While data can help advertisers â or anyone really â better understand the world, the scandal around Facebook and Cambridge Analytica stems from not being transparent about what exactly is happening behind the scenes.Â Facebook users may have thought they were just taking a personality test for academic research or playing a fun cow game, but these actions led data scientists â not just the software engineers at Facebook â to have access to unsuspected users' personal information.Â \"I think transparency is key to everything here. If youâre accessing someoneâs data, I think it works best when they know why and what value youâre getting out of it,\" said Patrick Ambron, CEO at BrandYourself.Â Ambron's business is fairly clear on how it makes money. That's in part because it's a subscription service rather than an advertising business like Facebook. BrandYourself sells a tool that scans people's social media accounts and flags certain content as problematic.Â \"Weâre a good case of it being a clear transaction of why youâre giving us your data, and youâre paying us money,\" Ambron told Mashable.Â Ogury also claims it is \"clear\" with user consent. All users are shown an agreement called \"Consent to Collection and Use of Data,\" which says that the data collected \"may include information about your device, location, email, application, and browsing usage.\" Pasquet, Ogury's founder, said that at least one of three people reads the agreement and does not choose to opt into the tracking.Â \"At the start we said the consumers are smart, and we should ask them directly if theyâre willing to share information,\" Pasquet said. On the other hand, Facebook users don't necessarily understand exactly how their activities are being monitored and why. It can seem impossible to stop it even if you delete the app. Pasquet mentioned a frustrating example where someone could see a surprise vacation their significant other booked via online ad tracking. Impending UK regulations will create more data protections overseas, but data remains vulnerable in the U.S. and beyond, at least for now Facebook could be forced or decide on its own to change that by updating its user agreement and surfacing it more often to its users, Ambron said. To prevent another Cambridge Analytica scandal, he also suggested creating stricter contracts with companies that use its data. Facebook should still make anonymized data available for academic researchers, like it's doing with Stanford economics professor Raj Chetty's America inequality study, but they need to do more thorough vetting and continuously audit, Ambron added.Â \"We as a society havenât figured out yet how to keep the societal contract agile enough to keep up with the real rapid pace of change, and I think we have to,\" Mintz said. \"Technological change is not going to slow down, and it canât just be a free for all.\" Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

At the timeÂ Business InsiderÂ published the exchange, Facebook had \"faced one privacy flap after another, usually following changes to the privacy policy or new product releases.\"Â But the company's attitude toward privacy, as reflected in Mark's early emails and IMs, features like Beacon and Instant Personalization, and the frequent changes to the privacy policy, has been consistently aggressive: Do something first, then see how people react. And this does appear to reflect Mark's own views of privacy, which seem to be that people shouldn't care about it as much as they do -- an attitude that very much reflects the attitude of his generation. After all, here's what early Facebook engineering boss, Harvard alum, and Zuckerberg confidant Charlie Cheever said in David Kirkpatrick's brilliantly-reported upcoming book The Facebook Effect. Kirkpatrick had this to say about Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in his book: \"Mark really does believe very much in transparency and the vision of an open society and open world, and so he wants to push people that way. I think he also understands that the way to get there is to give people granular control and comfort. He hopes you'll get more open, and he's kind of happy to help you get there. So for him, it's more of a means to an end. For me, I'm not as sure.\"Â Zuckerberg reportedly hackedÂ into people's email using their TheFacebook passwords... At one point early on on Facebook history, Zuckerberg - nervous about an upcoming report in theÂ Harvard Crimson, used \"TheFacebook\"Â login data ofÂ CrimsonÂ staff to crack into their Harvard email accounts to see if the paper was going to include a claim that he had stolen an idea for a TheFacebook feature called \"Visualize Your Buddy.\"Â Tim and Elisabeth decided to drop John's claims from the story. But, this time, they decided to go ahead and publish a story on ConnectU's claims against Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg was not content to wait until the morning to find out if the Crimson would include John's accusations in its story. Instead, he decided to access the email accounts of Crimson editors and review their emails. How did he do this? Here's how Mark described his hack to a friend: Mark used his site, TheFacebook.com, to look up members of the site who identified themselves as members of the Crimson. Then he examined a log of failed logins to see if any of the Crimson members had ever entered an incorrect password into TheFacebook.com. If the cases in which they had entered failed logins, Mark tried to use them to access the Crimson members' Harvard email accounts. He successfully accessed two of them. In other words, Mark appears to have used private login data from TheFacebook to hack into the separate email accounts of some TheFacebook users. In one account he accessed, Mark saw an email from Crimson writer Tim McGinn to Cameron, Tyler, and Divya. Another email Mark read was this one, from Crimson managing editor Elisabeth Theodore to Tim McGinn: OK, he did seem very sleazy. And I thought that some of his answers to the questions were not very direct or open. I also thought that his reaction to the website was very very weird. But, even if it's true so what? It's an [redacted] thing to do but it's not illegal, right? -Business Insider Lo and behold, Mark's cavalier attitude towards Facebook user data is costing him billionsÂ at a time he's actively shedding shares as part of a $12 billion liquidationÂ which started last September.Â"}

The social network acknowledged on Sunday, March 25, 2018, that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015 - first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) How Facebook was able to siphon off phone call and text logs How Facebook was able to siphon off phone call and text logs By RYAN NAKASHIMA and MAE ANDERSON Mar. 27, 2018 https://www.apnews.com/3bb6a06ca1f343b2be3a446f014da873 Link copied! The news that Facebook's Android app has been collecting call and text histories is yet another black eye for the social media giant. But just why was Facebook able to siphon off records of who its users were contacting — and when — in the first place? The short answer: Because Google let it. The longer answer: Well, it's complicated. The social network acknowledged on Sunday that it began uploading call and text logs from phones running Google's Android system in 2015 — first via its Messenger app and later through an option in Facebook Lite, a stripped-down version of its main app. Facebook added that only users who gave appropriate permission were affected, that it didn't collect the contents of messages or calls, and that users can opt out of the data collection and have the stored logs deleted by changing their app settings. Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for more specifics. The kerfuffle over this data collection, first reported by the website Ars Technica , follows a week of turmoil for the social network involving charges that it allowed political consultants to steal the data of 50 million users in order to influence elections. There's a reason Facebook's actions were restricted to Android phones. Apple locks down app permissions tightly, which offers more privacy protection to iPhone users. \"Apple's fundamental approach is to collect the minimum amount of information to keep the service running, and keep customers in control of the information,\" said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security firm Securosis. But Android has long been more indulgent. Until recently, in fact, Google let app developers gain access to a phone's call and text logs. All they needed was an app that required access to user contacts. Once users agreed, Android would then also grant access to those communication histories. Starting in 2012 with its \"Jelly Bean\" release, Android would notify people installing such apps that they were also giving apps access to their call and text logs, but still required them to agree to all those permissions at once. Rejecting the request meant the apps wouldn't work. It wasn't until 2015 when Google released Android 6.0, dubbed \"Marshmallow,\" that Android phones finally split up those permissions. That meant users could agree to share contacts, but reject access to their messaging and phone histories. That's the same year Facebook says its apps started collecting this information. But many Android users aren't using the latest version of the software. In fact, they often can't get it even if they want it. Apple owns both the software and hardware for iPhones, which allows it to push out new versions of its iOS operating software at will. Google, by contrast, is largely at the mercy of both mobile carriers and hardware makers when it comes to distributing new Android versions. There are nearly 20,000 Android phone models now in service, and carriers like to tweak the software for each to ensure that it will work as smoothly as possible on their networks. As a result, new Android versions reach users very slowly. As of January, about 65 percent of iPhone users were using the latest iOS software, introduced in 2017. Less than 1 percent of Android devices currently use the latest version of Android, known as \"Oreo.\" (Many of them are owners of Google's new Pixel phones, which get software updates directly from Google.) Just over half of all Android users are using the two previous versions, which allow them to specifically reject the sharing of communication logs. Last October, Google began forcing all apps to follow the new rules when they issue updates, even on phones running older versions of Android. All that leaves two big questions unanswered. Why did Google set up Android permissions this way? And how many other apps have taken advantages of the same setup? Experts and privacy advocates say the answer to the first question is probably related to Google's advertising-based business model, which — like Facebook — depends on collecting detailed information about users in order to target them with tailored ads. Apple, meanwhile, derives its profits from the sale of devices and services like Apple Music. Another possible factor: Android was playing catch-up with Apple for many years, and was eager to attract app developers in order to attain parity with Apple's App Store. Some app developers may have found greater access to user data on Android attractive — as Facebook did. Experts say it's not clear if other apps are going as far as Facebook in terms of tracking call history and texts, but it's very possible. \"In a lot of ways, Facebook is the tip of the iceberg,\" said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. \"There are plenty of other people doing this kind of data collection.\" It is unclear how many apps gained access to call logs so far or how many users' call logs had been sent to app developers. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. One major Android phone maker expressed uncertainty over its role in protecting user privacy. \"At this time the nature of the data breach is unclear so it is difficult to comment on the cause or the solution,\" LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday in a statement. ___ AP Technology Writer Youkyung Lee in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report."}

If publishers don’t sign the contract, GroupM said it would cease trading with them, claiming it would mean they aren’t necessarily compliant with the GDPR. Some publishers fear GroupM is pushing them to cover its own GDPR compliance needs, while leaving liability for fines firmly with the publisher. The media-buying giant has said it sent the Data Protection Addendum to all its suppliers and vendors âthat touch personal data in any wayâ in the European Union.Â The DPA is a contractually binding set of data protection principles that publishers would be expected to adhere to under the GDPR. The contract is nonnegotiable, according to the document. Publishersâ legal teams are reviewing the document, but five publishers Digiday spoke to are feeling rattled by the terminology in the contract, with some calling it a âTrojan horseâ document that could result in the publisher having to share the control of their data with Group M, promoting the agency group to be more like what the GDPR calls a data controller (from its current position as a data processor), which is the source of customer data. A data controller is regarded as a stronger position to be in, because they can communicate directly with the customer about consent needs, whereas a data processor doesn’t have that direct line of access as it uses data from a third-party source. A GroupM spokesperson sent the following statement: âGroupM has an extensive GDPR program of which the GroupM data addendum forms only one part. The GroupM Data Addendum was prepared for all GroupM suppliers processing personal data whether that personal data belonged to GroupM, its clients or the supplier in question. The intention of the Data Addendum is to clearly signal the GroupM commitment to data privacy and to ask our suppliers to demonstrate the same commitment.â The spokesperson added that the contract does not seek to impose any greater liability than already exists in the law and that the agency will handle publisher questions on a case-by-case basis. Asked about publisher concerns about cutting ties with GroupM if they donât sign, a GroupM spokesperson sent the following statement: âThe future of our relationships with suppliers will depend on the nature of the supplier in question and the processing activities it carries out and how it demonstrates its commitment to data privacy and in particular GDPR.â The issue of who is expected to gain consent from users and take liability for it is becoming clouded as GDPR enforcement looms. Publishers are known consumer brands and the source of the data. That means they’re in the best position to obtain consent from users with whom they have a direct relationship. For agencies and ad tech vendors further along the ad supply chain, itâs harder to gain consent. That has essentially put a target on publishers’ backs, with ad tech vendors and agencies trying to use them as vehicles to gain consent so they can continue ad targeting under the GDPR. Amid a long list of terms and conditions in the DPA is a section on tags and data collection, which outlines how GroupM will be allowed to drop cookies and profile audiences, along with sharing publisher data while taking no liability risk itself.Â The terms and conditions state that publisher sites must accept rich media tags and other ad-serving tags and that the âagency and advertiser shall have no liability for the effect of tags on the sites.â Industry sources said GroupM is essentially asking publishers to hand over their relationship with their audience — a big ask, given audience data is a publisherâs most precious asset. Publishersâ legal teams are reviewing the document, but so far, the general consensus is theyâre unlikely to sign the DPA. âAny publisher worth their salt won’t sign it,â said an industry executive. âIt flouts the spirit of GDPR and undermines the business models of most publishers.â GroupM’s contract comes at a time when Google is reportedlyÂ asking publishers to assume a “co-controller” position in GDPR compliance, wanting them to gain consent on its behalf for third-party websites and apps that use Google’s ad technology to sell ads, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Internet Advertising Bureau Europeâs Transparency & Consent Framework, aimed at getting the whole industry compliant before GDPR enforcement starts, also requires publishers to agree to get consent on behalf of any ad tech partners they want to trade with, though it is optional for publishers to use it. GroupM has opted to support the IAB Europe framework after scrapping its previous attempt to get publishers across the U.K. and EU countries to gain consent on its behalf — an initiative known as âPassportâ — because publishers refused to cooperate. “[GroupM explained] it as a very fair initiative for the market and that itâs in everyoneâs best interest for them to get consent this way,” said a publishing executive of the Passport initative. “But they have also said that if you [publishers] donât share consent, then they canât use the technology to buy it [publisher inventory] thatâs needed so theyâll have to stop trading. Itâs like blackmail.”"}

But with repeated and high-profile data breaches piling up, its days of unchecked authority might be numbered. Because internet technology has developed faster than state and federal privacy laws, Silicon Valley companies have for years been in charge of how the data they collect from their customers is used. Anyone browsing the web, performing a search on Google, or logging into Facebook operates on blind faith that the companies behind the technology will protect their private data and use it appropriately. But history has shown that faith-based system isnât exactly working. Yahoo user data was breached in 2013, 2014, and 2016. There was a massive breach of sensitive Equifax data in 2017. And Facebook is currently embroiled in a scandal over how its user data was used by right-wing political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Indeed, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is reportedly investigating whether the social media giant violated an agreement over privacy it made in 2011. California data protection law That most recent case has reignited conversations about whether federal and state governments should exert more oversight over so-called Big Tech. The willingness to do so will first be tested in coming months in Silicon Valleyâs backyard, as aÂ piece of legislation makes its way through Californiaâs state capitol in Sacramento. First introduced in February by assemblyman Marc Levine, the legislation seeks to establish a data protection authority that would be charged with regulating how big tech companies request and use Californiansâ personal data. The regulated data would includeÂ peopleâs names, social security numbers, driverâs license numbers, financial account data, medical data, and email addresses, among other information. âThese are the wealthiest corporations since God created light.â If passed by the legislature and signed into law by governor Jerry Brown, the authority would be an important and symbolic step toward reining in the power of technology companies. It would also be a bold signal by California to Washington that if federal lawmakers wonât step up to the challenge of monitoring giant technology companies, California will take matters into its own hands. âGiven that Facebook is in California and the questions about whether thereâs enough regulation of internet giants, maybe this could be a big thing,â says Eric Goldman, the co-director of the High Tech Law Institute at the Santa Clara University School of Law. The author of the bill certainly thinks so. Once a project manager for an open source encryption technology product, Levine switched gears in the mid-2000s and got into local politics. In 2012, he was elected to the California state legislature, where he represents communities in Marin and southern Sonoma. Now heâs readying to shepherd the idea of the California Data Protection Authority through the legislature. âThese are the wealthiest, most profitable corporations in all of world history, since God created light,â Levine says. âFor lawmakers, or even consumers of social media, to be hoodwinked into thinking that these are geeky college kids in garages, wearing hoodies and jamming on their keyboards writing code, is absolute garbage. These are the richest special interests ever and we have to get a handle on this.â Modeled on the EU Levineâs bill (AB 2182) was loosely designed in the image of a new law in the European Union called General Data Protection Regulation. That law put into place constraints on how tech companies can use peopleâs data, backed by very high penalties for violatorsâup to 4% of global annual revenue orÂ â¬20 million, whichever is higher. The proposed California authority would have the power to adopt regulations that would set data-privacy standards for the tech companies that operate just a few miles south of Levineâs district. Some of those include: Creating a standardized online user agreement aimed at helping people clearly understand what permissions they are giving to a company regarding the use and dissemination of their personal information. Establishing rules around how a personâs information will be removed from a companyâs database if the person chooses to stop being a customer. âI think this is important for where it may lead,â says Ari Waldman, the director of the New York Law Schoolâs Innovation Center for Law and Technology. âItâs a baby step in the right direction. We undoubtedly need a data protection authority in this country above and beyond the FTC.â âItâs a baby step in the right direction.â If the regulatory authority is established in California, itâs conceivable that any rules it imposes could set data-privacy policy for the rest of the nation. Thatâs because itâsÂ difficult for companies to quickly ascertain whether any one particular piece of data comes from California or someplace else. Therefore, in order to comply with California law, companies would likely have to adopt nationwide standards based on the actions of California regulators, Waldman says. No enforcement powers Still, the proposed law is imperfect. Even if the state establishes a regulatory authority to monitor data privacy, the wording of the bill is such that the agency would have no enforcement powers. Levine says he plans to speak to the governor to request money be set aside for his proposed authorityâsomething in the âseven figureâ range (he suggested about $7 million) to get it started, and then more down the line. The Consumer Technology Association declined to comment for this story. A representative with the California Technology Council said his group had held several meetings to discuss the proposed legislation, but declined to offer further comment. Both groups represent the interests of technology companies. Itâs still early. The bill needs to be approved by at least one state assembly committee before itâs put up to vote. It has been referred to theÂ committee on privacy and consumer protection but has yet to be formally debated. âI think a lot of people, including lawmakers, are dazzled by the industry leaders of Big Tech,â Levine says. âIf youâve ever seen someone take a tour of the Googleplex or the Facebook office, itâs like itâs a Disneyland, a place of wonder. We need to dispel that in Sacramento.â"}

That Could Get You Into Trouble - The Quint","text":"Sharing Data With Facebook Apps? That Could Get You Into Trouble There are thousands of interactive games, quizzes, and applications online that people from all over the world play or use on a daily basis. But what if we told you that many of these could be stealing or mining your personal data. Considering the smartphone market in India is expanding by the day and the internet costs less than peanuts, itâs no surprise that the number of active users playing these games and interacting with these online applications is also growing rapidly. The recent âCambridge Analyticaâ fiasco has opened yet another can of worms for not only such Facebook users, but also numerous data mining organisations that heavily bank upon the userâs data. You can know more about how to safeguard your online data in the Facebook live below: This Ainât No Game Facebookâs data servers and its whole digital infrastructure is a fortress, and even impregnable in certain ways, but recent events make way for certain skepticism on how safe is the data that Facebook users are sharing online. India is the largest user of Facebook, and the avid social media user invests an adequate amount of time online playing games like Criminal Case, Farmville and even Texas HoldEm Poker (top games being played by Indian users). And guess what, all these games need you to sign up with your Facebook account. Most of the games on Facebook need to access your Facebook ID (Photo: Facebook.com screenshot) However, apart from these, there are a lot of interactive applications/games that people play and they not only have to log in through Facebook, but they also have to provide access to sensitive data like location, contacts, and even your phoneâs gallery! Games/apps like âWho has a secret crush on you?â or â What would you look like as the opposite-sex? â are some common examples. Some users are so overwhelmed by the curiosity that they tend to ignore some of the risks involved, and inadvertently give the app access to sensitive data. The whole âCambridge Analyticaâ debacle is based on the data leaked on a similar app developed by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who collected the data and passed it to Cambridge Analytica. The app called âThis is Your Digital Lifeâ on Facebook mined nearly 2,70,000 userâ data. According to The Verge, the ex-Cambridge Analytica employee and a whistle-blower has called the whole thing as an âunethical actâ as it was carried out without Facebookâs knowledge and many others were kept in the dark. I suppose the most worrying bit is that something like this could be happening in India, which could even have a boding on how our general elections pan out! Whatâs More Important: Your Privacy or Fun? Facebook users playing these online games click on random applications to know details like âWhich Game of Thrones character are you?â or âWhen will you get married?â However, you need to realise there is a lot at stake here! Certain apps on Facebook require your permission to post and let you use the app. (Photo: Facebook.com screenshot) However, there is also a way for users who use the Facebook app on the mobiles to know what apps have their data. Hereâs how you can track all the apps: Tap the appâs Settings tab on the top right corner. Scroll down and select the âPrivacy Shortcutsâ option. Select the first option âPrivacy Checkupâ and tap next till you reach âYour App Privacyâ option. Below is the video demo of the same. Itâs always recommended that you delete or deny access to the apps that you do not use anymore. Itâs much safer that way. But, if you must absolutely use these kind of app to find out âwhen you will get married?â itâs in your best interest to deny the app any kind of access to your contacts list, friends list, and location to prevent these apps from gaining access to your data. And, if the apps do not let you proceed further, so be it. Think about it, whatâs more important? A little fun or your privacy?

Personal information ended up where it was not authorized to go because a company exploited Facebook's architecture at the time. That's a data breach.

Every scandal that Trump is revealed to be a part of makes his base more likely to support him, not less. And they relate to his thorough ineptitude and unwillingness to learn even the basics of policy. They WANT an incompetent white guy who can get away with anything. What 2016 demonstrated was what a significant swath of this country will sacrifice to preserve white supremacy and toxic masculinity: everything. Qualifications, experience, temperament, our national security, our institutions. Trump voters sacrificed them all at the ballot. A Black President and the prospect of a woman President were signals that white men would have to compete on a level playing field with women and people of color. That's what Trump voters feared the most. So they made the ways Trump was unqualified or morally abysmal into pluses. Getting real sick of the line \"Dems can't just be anti-Trump\" as if the candidates we've run thus far are simply that. It also implies that making the midterm election a referendum on Trump is a bad strategy. It's not. Running against Trump is extremely good and you should do it. You see GOP strategists push the \"Democrats can't just be anti-Trump\" line for two reasons: to misrepresent the Democratic Party's broader agenda and to make the more old school Democratic strategists afraid of coming off as too anti-Trump. Don't fall for it. The GOP engaged in aggressive anti-Obama messaging to the point that Dems ran away from his signature achievement in two midterms. The GOP is trying to convince you \"Dems can't just be anti-Trump\" because they don't want to be in a position to run away from Trump and his base. 1. Trump Jr.'s emails made clear before the meeting that it was about info on Hillary and in the context \"Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" 2. Even if nothing of value was obtained, solicitation of something value from a foreign national is against the law. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on sexual harassment and misconduct in the federal judiciary is underway. Sen. Grassley: \"The judicial branch has a problem. They have to deal with it, or Congress will have to do it for the courts.\" Earlier this month, the judiciary's workplace conduct working group released a series of recommendations for improving how the judiciary handles misconduct: uscourts.gov/news/2018/06/0â¦ Grassley called it a \"vague report\" that \"kicks the can down the road\" The judiciary has dealt with allegations of harassment and misconduct by judges before, but it was @mattzap's story on accusations against former 9th Circuit judge Alex Kozinski that spurred all of this. His original story: washingtonpost.com/world/nationalâ¦ Antisemitism is so prevalent in part because it is extremely useful as misdirection. The Koch brothers spend millions trying to reshape education, fund a gigantic web of think tanks and organisations to influence politics, and conservatives still say \"...but George Soros!\" Robert Mercer, who owes the US government $7 billion in tax, funded Cambridge Analytica so that he can influence elections. He also funded antisemitic, white supremacist rag Breitbart, which constantly railed against \"globalists\" and other dogwhistle terms for Jewish people. The extremely wealthy, like the Kochs, like the Mercers, enjoy doing openly everything that they accuse Jews of doing in secret, without any of the scrutiny. And that is pure unbridled antisemitism at work. Cambridge Analytica who worked with Trumpâs team and the winning Brexit campaign harvested millions ofÂ FBÂ profiles of US voters, in the tech giantâs biggest ever data breach, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. They used personal information taken without authorization in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements."}

A researcher at Vanderbilt University in the US is claiming more than 2,100 patient deaths are linked to hospital data breaches each year. Sung Choi of the university's Owen Graduate School of Management said data breaches trigger remediation activities, regulatory inquiries and litigation in the years following a breach, that disrupt and delay hospital services leading to a decline in care, according to the Wall Street Journal. âBefore a breach, the control group and breached hospitals are similar, then after a breach there appears some change in trend that made the breach hospitals have worse quality,â Choi said. The comments were made at a cyber-risk quantification conference hosted by Drexel University's LeBow College of Business in Philadelphia, USA, as the Doctor cited data from the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to compare patient-care metrics at hospitals that have and have not experienced a data breach.Choi argued the proportion of heart attack patients who die within 30 days of being admitted to a hospital increased by 0.23 percent one year after a breach and by 0.36 percent two years after a breach, which represents 2,160 additional patient deaths annually. Leon Lerman, co-founder and CEO of healthcare cyber-security specialist Cynerio, said it's difficult to get the medical devices back up and running following a breach with many devices requiring assistance from the manufacturers in order to reset them. He went on to say that disruption doesn't have to be caused directly by the breach or attack but could be caused during the investigation process. âI think it's fair and logical to say that the more often these breaches occur the more likely there will be an increase in patient mortality rates, as it's very likely that during a breach some sort of service disruption will occur and the doctor will be preoccupied and won't be giving full attention to a patient,â Lerman said. Ultimately, Lerman said, it depends on if the breach or attack is visible to the doctors or not to understand the extent of the correlation of attacks."}

US social media company Facebook says it has suspended the account of Cambridge Analytica, an American-British data analysis firm hired in 2016 by US President Donald Trump's election campaign, amid reports it collected the personal information of millions of American voters without their permission. The accounts of its parent organization, Strategic Communication Laboratories, were also suspended, as well as those of University of Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan and Christopher Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Kogan, according to The New York Times and The Observer. The social networking service stole the profile information of 50 million Facebook users in the tech giant's biggest-ever data breach, to help them design software to predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box, profiles, the two newspapers reported. Cambridge Analytica was financed by US hedge fund billionaire and Republican Party donor Robert Mercer to the tune of $15 million. The Observer, a UK newspaper, said Cambridge Analytica was headed at the time by Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist until he was fired in August. \"In 2015, we learned that ... Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe,\" Facebook vice president and deputy general counsel Paul Grewal said in a posting on Friday. Kogan legitimately obtained the information but \"violated platform policies\" by passing information to Cambridge Analytica and Wylie, the posting said. Facebook said it removed the app in 2015 when it learned of the violation, and was told by Kogan and everyone who received the data that it had since been destroyed. Kogan's app offered a personality prediction test, describing itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\" Some 270,000 people downloaded the app, allowing Kogan to access information such as the city listed on their profile, or content they had \"liked.\" \"However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers' Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong,\" The Observer reported. Cambridge Analytica said it was in contact with Facebook \"in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.\" It blamed the misuse of data on Kogan and said it has since deleted all the data it received from a company he founded, Global Science Research (GSR). However, The New York Times reported that copies of the data gathered for Cambridge Analytica were still online and that its journalists had viewed some of the raw data. Wylie, who later became a whistleblower, told The Observer: \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles.

Giving evidence today, to a UK parliamentary select committeeÂ that’s investigating the use of disinformation in political campaigning, Wylie said: “The 50 million number is what the media has felt safest to report — because of the documentation that they can rely on —Â but my recollection is that it was substantially higher than that. So my own view is it was much more than 50M.” We’ve reached out to Facebook about Wylie’s claim — but at the time of writing the company had not provided a response. “There were several iterations of the Facebook harvesting project,” Wylie also told the committee, fleshing out the process through which he says users’ data was obtained by CA. “It first started as a very small pilot — firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an electoral register… We then scaled out slightly to make sure that [Cambridge University professor Alexsandr Kogan] could acquire data in the speed that he said he could [via a personality test app called thisisyourdigitallifeÂ deployed via Facebook’s platform]. So the first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined the app — that was in late May 2014. “That project went really well and that’s when we signed a much larger contract with GSR [Kogan’s company] in the first week of June… 2014. Where the app went out and collected surveys and people joined the app throughout the summer of 2014.” The personal information the app was able to obtain via Facebook formed the “foundational dataset” underpinning both CA and its targeting models, according to Wylie. “This is what built the company,” he claimed. “This was the foundational dataset that then was modeled to create the algorithms.” Facebook has previously confirmedÂ 270,000 people downloaded Kogan’s app — a data harvesting route which, thanks to the lax structure of Facebook’s APIs at the time, enabled the foreign political consultancy firm to acquire information on more than 50 million Facebook users, according to the Observer, the vast majority of whom would have had no idea their data had been passed to CA because they were never personally asked to consent to it. Instead, their friends were ‘consenting’ on their behalf — likely also without realizing. Earlier this month, after the latest CA revelations broke, the DCMS committee asked Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to answer their questions in person but he has so far declined their summons. Though it has just been reportedÂ that he may finally appear before Congress to face questions about how users’ data has been so widely misused via his platform. In a letter to the DCMS committee, dated yesterday, Facebook said it is working with regulators in different countries to confirm exactly how many local users have been affected by data leak. It adds that around 1 per cent of the users whose data was illicitly obtained by CA were European Union users. This small proportion seems unsurprising, given CA was working for the Trump campaign — and therefore aiming to gather data on Americans for 2016 presidential campaign targeting purposes.Â EU citizens’ data wouldn’t have had any relevance to that. “There will be two sets of data,” Facebook writes in its letter to the committee discussing the data passed to CA. “The first is people who downloaded the app, and the second is the number of friends of those people who have their privacy settings set in such a way that the app could see some of their data. This second figure will be much higher than the first and we will look to provide both broken down by country as soon as we can.” Facebook’s privacy settings have caused major regulatory and legal headaches for the company over the years. In 2012, for example, FacebookÂ settled with theÂ FTC over charges it had deceived usersÂ by âtelling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made publicâ. And in 2011 and 2012, following a legal complaint by European privacy campaigner and lawyer Max Schrems, Facebook was urged by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner to tighten app permissions to avoid exactly the kind of friends data leakage that has now scaled into this major privacy scandal. Instead, Facebook put off tightening up API permissions until as late as mid 2015 — thereby giving CA a window of opportunity to pull massive amounts of Facebook user data ahead of the 2016 US presidential election. When CA’s (currently suspended) CEO, Alexander Nix, appeared before the DCMS committee in February he was asked whether it worked with GSR and what use it made of GSR data. At that time Nix claimed CA had not used any GSR data. The company is continuing to push this line, claiming in a series of tweets today that while it paid $500k for GSR data it subsequently “deleted the data”. It further claims it used alternative data sources and data sets to build its models. “Our algorithms and models bear no trace of it,” it has also tweeted re: the GSR data. (Following the session, CA has also now put out a longer response statement, refuting multiple parts of Wylie’s testimony and claiming he has “misrepresented himself and the company”. In this it also claims: “Cambridge Analytica does not hold any GSR data or any data derived from GSR data. We have never shared the GSR data with Aggregate IQ [another alleged affiliate company], Palantir or any other entity. Cambridge Analytica did not use any GSR data in the work that we did for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.”) Asked by the committee about Nix’s earlier, contradicting testimony, Wylie wondered out loud why CA spent “the better part of $1M on GSR” — pointing also to “copious amounts of email” and other documents he says he has provided to the committee as additional evidence, including invoicing and “match rates on the data”. “That’s just not true,” he asserted of CA’s claim not to have used GSR (and therefore Facebook) data. Kogan himself has previously claimed he was unaware exactly what CA wanted to use the data for. “I knew it was for political consulting but beyond that no idea,” he told Anderson Cooper in a TV interview broadcast on March 21, claiming also that he did not know that CA was working for Trump or whether they even used the data his app had gathered. Kogan also suggested the data he had been able to gather was not very accurate at an individual level — claiming it would only be useful in aggregate to, for example, “understand the personality of New Yorkers”. Wylie was asked by the committee how the data was used by CA. Giving an example he says the company’s approach was to target different people for advertising based on their “dispositional attributes and personality traits” — traits it sought to predict via patterns in the data. He said: For example, if you are able to create profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits — so let’s say a high degree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism — and when you look at that profiles that’s the profile of a person who’s more prone towards conspiratorial thinking, for example, they’re open enough to kind of connect to things that may not really seem reasonable to your average person. And they’re anxious enough and impulse enough to start clicking and reading and looking at things — and so if you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more prone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, you can identify what that person looks like in data terms. You can then go out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more conspiratorial messaging. And then advertise or target them with blogs or websites or various — what everyone now calls fake news — so that they start seeing all of these ideas, or all of these stories around them in their digital environment. They don’t see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC.Â And they start to go well why is that everyone’s talking about this online? Why is it that I’m seeing everything here but the mainstream media isn’t talking about [it]… Not everyone’s going to adopt that — so that advantage of using profiling is you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to adopting that idea as your early adopters… So if you can find those people in your datasets because you know what they look like in terms of data you can catalyze a trend over time. But you first need to find what those people look like. “That was the basis of a lot of our research [at CA and sister company SCL],” he added. “How far can we go with certain types of people. And who is it that we would need to target with what types of messaging.” Wylie told the committee that Kogan’s company was set up exclusively for the purposes of obtaining data for CA, and said the firm chose to work with Kogan because another professor it had approached first had asked for a substantial payment up front and a 50% equity share — whereas he had agreed to work on the project to obtain the data first, and consider commercial terms later. “The deal was that [Kogan] could keep all the data and do research or whatever he wanted to do with is and so for him it was appealing because you had a company that was the equivalent of no academic grant could compete with the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we didn’t have to go through all the compliance stuff,” added Wylie. “So we could literally just start next week and pay for whatever you want. So my impression at the time was that for an academic that would be quite appealing.” “All kinds of people [had] access to the data” Another claim made by Wylie during the session was that the secretive US big data firm Palantir helped CA build models off of the Facebook data — although he also said there was no formal contract in place between the two firms. Wylie said Palantir was introduced to CA’s Nix by Sophie Schmidt, Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s daughter, during an internship at CA. “We actually had several meetings with Palantir whilst I was there,” claimed Wylie. “And some of the documentation that I’ve also provided to the committee… [shows] there were senior Palantir employees that were also working on the Facebook data.” The VC-backed firm is known for providing government, finance, healthcare and other organizations with analytics, security and other data management solutions. “That was not an official contract between Palantir and Cambridge Analytica but there were Palantir staff who would come into the office and work on the data,” Wylie added. “And we would go and meet with Palantir staff at Palantir. So, just to clarify, Palantir didn’t officially contract with Cambridge Analytica. But there were Palantir staff who helped build the models that we were working on.” Contacted for comment on this allegation a Palantir spokesperson refuted it entirely — providing TechCrunch with this emailed statement: “Palantir has never had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica nor have we ever worked on any Cambridge Analytica data.” The committee went on to ask Wylie why he was coming forward to tell this story now, given his involvement in building the targeting technologies — and therefore also his interests in the related political campaigns. Wylie responded by saying that he had grown increasingly uncomfortable with CA during his time working there and with the methods being used. “Nothing good has come from Cambridge Analytica,” he added. “It’s not a legitimate business.” In a statement put out on its Twitter yesterday, CA’s acting CEO Alex Tayler sought to distance the firm from Wylie and play down his role there, claiming: âThe source of allegations is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the companyâs intellectual property.” Asked whether he’s received any legal threats since making his allegations public, Wylie said the most legal pushback he’s received so far has come from Facebook, rather than CA. “It’s Facebook who’s most upset about this story,” he told the committee. “They’ve sent some fairly intimidating legal correspondence. They haven’t actually taken action on that… They’ve gone silent, they won’t talk to me anymore. “But I do anticipate some robust pushback from Cambridge Analytica because this is sort of an existential crisis for them,” he added. “But I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defense to breaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality [that he previously signed with CA].” The committee also pressed Wylie on whether he himself had had access to the Facebook data he claims CA used to build its targeting models. Wylie said that he had, though he claims he deleted his copy of the data “some time in 2015”. During the testimony Wylie also suggested Facebook might have found out about the GSL data harvesting project as early as July 2014 — because he says Kogan told him, around that time, that he had spoken to Facebook engineers after his app’s data collection rate had been throttled by the platform. “He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at Facebook,” said Wylie. “So Facebook would have known from that moment about the project because he had a conversation with Facebook’s engineers — or at least that’s what he told me… Facebook’s account of it is that they had no idea until the Guardian first reported it at the end of 2015 — and then they decided to send out letters. They sent letters to me in August 2016 asking do you know where this data might be, or was it deleted? “It’s interesting that… the date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica officially joined the Trump campaign. So I’m not sure if Facebook was genuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of y’know now this firm is not just some random firm in Britain, it’s now working for a presidential campaign.” We also asked Facebook if it had any general response to Wylie’s testimony but at the time of writing the company had not responded to this request for comment either. Did Facebook make any efforts to retrieve or delete data, the committee also asked Wylie. “No they didn’t,” he replied. “Not to my knowledge. They certainly didn’t with me — until after I went public and then they made me suspect number one despite the fact the ICO [UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office] wrote to me and to Facebook saying that no I’ve actually given over everything to the authorities.” “I suspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016… they went if we make a big deal of this this might be optically not the best thing to make a big fuss about,” he said. “So I don’t think they pushed it in part because if you want to really investigate a large data breach that’s going to get out and that might cause problems. So my impression was they wanted to push it under the rug.” “All kinds of people [had] access to the data,” he added. “It was everywhere.”"}

The Massachusetts attorney general said her office was launching an investigation after the news reports. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” Maura Healey said on Twitter in a post that linked to a Times report. The United Kingdom’s Information Commission also announced on Saturday they are conducting an investigation of Cambridge Analytica, which also had clients in the country. “Any criminal and civil enforcement actions arising from the investigation will be pursued vigorously,” said Elizabeth Denham, Information Commissioner. Facebook on Friday said it was suspending Cambridge Analytica after finding data privacy policies had been violated. The newspapers, which cited former Cambridge Analytica employees, associates and documents, said the data breach was one of the largest in the history of Facebook Inc. The Observer said Cambridge Analytica used the data, taken without authorization in early 2014, to build a software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. It quoted whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who helped set up Cambridge Analytica and worked with an academic at Cambridge University to obtain the data, as saying the system could profile individual voters to target them with personalized political advertisements. The more than 50 million profiles represented about a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential U.S. voters, at the time, the Observer said. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on,” Wylie told the Observer. The New York Times said interviews with a half-dozen former Cambridge Analytica employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, revealed it not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of it. The Observer said the data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use, the Observer said. However, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong, the Observer said. It said Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app and barred it from being sold on or used for advertising. Facebook said it acted against Cambridge Analytica and SCL after receiving reports they did not delete information about Facebook users that had been inappropriately shared. bit.ly/2FZU1Ir A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said GSR “was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.” “When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR,” he said. “We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,” the spokesman said. He said “no data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.” Related Coverage $6.2 MILLION FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN Trump’s campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. A Trump campaign official said the campaign used the Republican National Committee for its voter data in 2016, not Cambridge Analytica. “Any claims that voter data were used from another source to support the victory in 2016 are false,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In past interviews with Reuters, Brad Parscale, who ran Trump’s digital ad operation in 2016 and is his 2020 re-election campaign manager, has said Cambridge Analytica played a minor role as a contractor in the 2016 campaign. He said the campaign used voter data from a Republican-affiliated organization rather than Cambridge Analytica. He declined to comment on Friday. On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it “provided the Donald J. Trump for President campaign with the expertise and insights that helped win the White House.” Facebook did not mention the Trump campaign or any other campaigns in its statement. “We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior,” Facebook said, adding that it was continuing to investigate the claims. In a Twitter post, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos called the news reports “important and powerful” but said it was “incorrect to call this a ‘breach’ under any reasonable definition of the term.” “We can condemn this behavior while being accurate in our description of it,” he said. Acknowledging an episode as a data breach can carry legal significance, as companies face a patchwork of state and federal requirements to notify customers and regulators when they detect that information has been compromised. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, said the case was “more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West” and showed the need for Congress to pass legislation to bring transparency and accountability to online political advertisements. A source close to the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign said the Trump campaign likely will need to address whether it was aware of Cambridge Analytica’s methods for obtaining its data or if the data was leveraged during the election. Cambridge Analytica says it uses “behavioral microtargeting,” or combining analysis of people’s personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behavior. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two-thirds of the U.S. population. It has worked on other campaigns in the United States and other countries, and is funded by Robert Mercer, a prominent supporter of politically conservative groups. Facebook in its statement described a rocky relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie going back to 2015. That year, Facebook said, it learned that Kogan lied to the company and violated its policies by sharing data he acquired with a so-called “research app” that used Facebook’s login system. Kogan was not immediately available for comment. The thisisyourdigitallife app was downloaded by about 270,000 people. Facebook said Kogan gained access to profile and other information “in a legitimate way” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” when he passed the data to SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie. Facebook said it cut ties to Kogan’s app when it learned of the violation, and asked for certification from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Although all certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook said it received reports in the past several days that “not all data was deleted.” FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is seen at the Facebook Gather conference in Brussels, Belgium January 23, 2018.

{"originalUrl":"https://thebea.st/2pJCZ7i?source=facebook&via=desktop","title":"Trump Does Trump, and Things Get Worse","text":"Mandel Ngan/Getty Amidst the numbing chaos that is the Trump administration, these past few days are worth reflecting on because three events have moved the needle in a bad direction. 1. The hiring of John Bolton highlights Donald Trumpâs instability, his total lack of any coherent worldview, and most of allâand most dangerously of allâhis need to feel that no limits are being imposed on him. Hereâs what I mean. When talking foreign policy, sometimes Trump sounds like Bolton, with all that overheated rhetoric heâs thrown at Kim Jong Un. But at other times, heâs an isolationist. At still other times, like when heâs agreeing to meet with Kim with no preconditions, heâs a Neville Chamberlain in the making. (By the way, is Lloydâs of London taking odds yet on whether that summit will actually happen?) So if he wasnât happy with H.R. McMaster and wanted new blood, he could have gone in any number of ways. That he chose the guy who will reinforce his worst instincts tells us, I think, that what he values most (aside from unquestioning loyalty) is someone who wonât hem him in; in other words, Trump may decide to launch a first strike against North Korea, or he may not. But if he does, by God, he doesnât want some globalist ninny telling him not to. So the principle at work here is not hawkishness per se. Itâs having someone who wonât tell him no. Remember how Fred Flintstone, when he was thinking of stealing the vacation money to buy a new bowling ball, would have a little angel and little devil pop up on each shoulder making their respective cases? Bolton is Trumpâs little devil, and clearly, Trump wanted things that way. 2. Trumpâs slapstick handling of the budget shows usâagain, but probably more than anything before itâjust how massively in over his head he is in the job. As Michael Grunwald wrote in Politico last week, Trump just got rolled by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. They didnât get their Dreamers request, but they got everything else, and Trump got very little. Thirty-three miles of border fence but no sanctuary cities defunding, no Planned Parenthood defunding, and not much else. Yes, it was congressional Republicans who cut these deals, not Trump. But Trump couldnât cut them, or credibly refute cutting them, because he doesnât know enough to do one or the other. He knows nothing about the ins and outs of the budget. And that ridiculous feint last Friday morning that he was going to veto itâ¦Â He relented after a few people with some actual knowledge told him how suicidal that would be, let alone on his way out to another weekend at Mar a Lago. But it was embarrassing. 3. The Stormy Daniels story was kind of non-newsy on certain levels. That Trump slept with a porn star and behaved crudely toward her is about the least shocking thing in the world. But the threats made against her are the real story here. Thatâs going to be the new iteration of this story, and depending on how it plays out it stands the chance of reminding the country of something that many have forgotten, or never knew: The president of the United States has mob ties. Hereâs David Cay Johnston cataloguing a few of them, like how Trump went out of his way to use Mafia-controlled companies to pour the concrete for Trump Tower. The great Wayne Barrett was the master chronicler of all this, going back to the 1990s. All you need to know for now is that back in the day, the government of Australia denied him a permit to open a casino in Sydney because the government deemed him to be too mobbed up. Trump will say of this failure that he lost interest in Australia, but Australia also lost interest in him. Weâre bound to see some more reporting about the nature of these threats that Daniels discussed on 60 Minutes Sunday night. What else do Daniels and that swashbuckling lawyer of hers have with regard to these threats? Is Robert Mueller maybe looking into who made them on Trumpâs behalf? Is Mueller going to interview Michael Cohen one of these days? That might be Muellerâs best path to Trump. Depending on where this goes, Americans could learn some interesting things about the past associations of the man who now embodies our democratic republic. And now we hear that Trump may want to be his own chief of staff. Hey, why not? A president needs a chief of staff only when he relies on staff. When he does things like read, and look at evidence. Trump doesnât need anyone. He has his TV. If they donât say it on Fox & Friends, how important can it be, anyway? As we think back over these 14 months, we recall that the madness started literally on the first day, with the speech about âcarnageâ and the protests about his crowd size. And every week has brought jaw-dropping moments, too many to count. But this is different. Trump has spent a year-plus feeling that he was heeding the advice of these wise people in Washington (he wasnât really, but in his mind he was), and it hasnât made him happy. Now heâs finished with that. Itâs one thing to run a privately held company on the fly, trusting the same âgutâ that drove you into multiple bankruptcies. But to make the fate of the country, its people, andâin the case of North Korea and possibly Iranâits volunteer soldiers, hinge on your uninformed gut is criminal. I mean that figuratively, for now. But Mueller may make it literal. Shocking as these last few days have been, there is still worse yet to come."}

Johnson, who reports to the company's India-born chief executive Satya Nadella, said the Redmond, US-based corporation has always been \"principalled\" about privacy, and affirmed its commitment to keep the individuals' data secure. \"Our belief is that our customer's data is their data. it is our job to help keep it secure for them,\" she said. To illustrate the increase in regulations, Johnson who was in Mumbai on Monday cited the example of Europe which has introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regime, which tech companies have to adhere to. It can be noted that following the revelations that data of over 50 million Facebook users could have been illegally accessed for influencing electoral results by the London-based consultancy Cambridge Analytica, the social network had volunteered to be regulated more closely. Johnson said technology alone can help overcome the present set of worries which allegedly owe its genesis to misuse of the technology itself. \"Technology can actually help the problem that is surfacing now. Things like blockchain can be a part of the solution here, because it is transparent, it is secure... It can actually be a part of the solution to some of these concerns that are being raised by the regulators,\" she said, adding her company is already building on such solutions through its cloud platform Azure. She said the company has been working on cybersecurity and has helped as many as 125 Indian companies with protecting their data since launching the offering in mid-2016 through a dedicated centre that works closely with academia as well. On the recent car crash involving a driverless car in the US, which killed one pedestrian, Johnson said Uber did the right thing by stalling the autonomous car experiments and added that more simulation using the tech is the solution to avoid any mishaps in the future. \"I think AI (artificial intelligence) can help that situation. I think if you can gather data and run simulations, rather than actual cars (on the road),\" she said. \"Stopping the testing was right thing to do till they (Uber) analyse what went wrong there. I just think going forward, any company that is testing autonomous vehicles may find that AI simulations can be a tool for them to test some of the cases,\" she added. The company, which has a tie-up with Uber's domestic rival Ola, says the partnership is doing great and Microsoft will continue to help it realise the vision of creating a connected vehicle. Johnson said the company wants to \"democratise AI\" tools and is already working on the healthcare and the agriculture sector in the country. In healthcare, the interventions are focused on the oncology or cancer diagnosis and treatment front, and also ophthalmology, while in agriculture, it has a tie-up with a state-run institute. The AI-led interventions have led to a 30 per cent increase in productivity for the farmers, and also helped in preserving the quality of the soil, she said, underlining that the latter is very important from a sustainability perspective. âPTI"}
{"originalUrl":"http://theantimedia.com/south-park-facebook-privacy-scandal/","title":"Facebook Privacy Scandal: South Park Tried to Warn Us, We Didn't Listen","text":"Facebook Privacy Scandal: South Park Tried to Warn Us, but We Didn’t Listen (ANTIMEDIA)Â â Facebook is bleeding users and credibility as it continues to face scrutiny for its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which dominated headlines last week. One major point of contention is Facebookâs acquisition of usersâ contact lists. Iâve just looked at the data files I requested from Facebook and they had every single phone number in my contacts. They had every single social event I went to, a list of all my friends (and their birthdays) and a list of every text Iâve sent. But in a statementÂ issuedÂ this week, Facebook subtly rebuked the outrage, explaining they disclose their practice when users sign up: âThe most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with. So, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, itâs a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contactsâ¦ âContact uploading is optional. People are expressly asked if they want to give permission to upload their contacts from their phone â itâs explained right there in the apps when you get started.Â People can delete previously uploaded information at any time and can find all the information available to them in their account and activity log from our Download Your Information tool.â [emphasis added] Facebook has been exploiting user data for quite some time, though it now faces heightened criticism in the context of Donald Trumpâs rise to power. But South Park, the long-running, highly-controversial adult animated series, actually offered biting commentary years ago on the subject of users signing away their rights. In its Season 15 premiere, aired in 2011, the show poked fun at consumersâ habit of agreeing to terms of service without ever reading the fine print. In a particularly grotesque South Park episode, the show imagines the now-deceased Steve Jobs kidnapping Apple users to be part of a âhumancentiPadâ experiment, attaching the users together âfrom mouth to anus.â The consumers used in the experiment are outraged and horrified as they wait in a jail cell. When Kyle, a main character, is also rounded up to be part of the humancentiPad, another woman asks him, “You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions, too?” “I just clicked ‘Agree.’ I didn’t read it,” she says frantically. “I was in a hurry, you see, and I-I didn’t know what I was agreeing to!” In a later scene, Kyle says he wants out of the experiment, and Jobs hands him a contract to sign that the late Apple chief says will release him.Â âFine, you donât want to be part of this? Then just sign right here,âÂ Jobs tells him. Kyle quickly scribbles his signature, and Jobs immediately exclaims,Â âNo! You didnât read it! This says we donât ever have to let you out and we can do whatever we want! Damn it, why wonât it read?âÂ Jobs yells (âitâ refers to his newly-created âhumancentiPad,â comprised of multiple unsuspecting people who didnât read the terms of service before they consented). Though this South Park episode focuses on Apple â which has its ownÂ issuesÂ with data abuse â the sentiment is easily applicable to other giant companies. To be sure, Â thereâs no doubt Facebook and other companies should be in hot water for their abusive data policies. As Edward SnowdenÂ notedÂ on Twitter last week: âFacebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post. âThey are not victims. They are accomplices. Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as âsurveillance companiesâ. Their rebranding as âsocial mediaâ is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.â Nevertheless, without some semblance of self-responsibility from the users who agreed to submit to these practices, itâs doubtful anything will change. â¦We have a small favor to ask. Fewer and fewer people are seeing Anti-Media articles as social media sites crack down on us, and advertising revenues across the board are quickly declining. However, unlike many news organizations, we havenât put up a paywall because we value open and accessible journalism over profit â but at this point, weâre barely even breaking even. Hopefully, you can see why we need to ask for your help. Anti-Mediaâs independent journalism and analysis takes substantial time, resources, and effort to produce, but we do it because we believe in our message and hope you do, too. If everyone who reads our reporting and finds value in it helps fund it, our future can be much more secure. For as little as $1 and a minute of your time, you can support Anti-Media. Thank you.

The demands came in response to news reports Saturday about how the firm, Cambridge Analytica, used a feature once available to Facebook app developers to collect information on 270,000 people and, in the process,Â gain access toÂ data on tens of millions of their Facebook âfriendsâ â few, if any, of whom had given explicit permission for this sharing. Though both companies have been embroiled in investigations in Washington and London for months, this weekendâs demands have taken on a more personal tone, focusing explicitly on Zuckerberg, who has not testified publicly on these matters in either nation. âThey say âtrust us,â but Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order toÂ targetÂ political advertising and manipulate voters,â Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said Saturday night. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, echoed the call for Zuckerberg to personally appear for questioning on Capitol Hill. âI think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees, and not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space. There's still a lot we're learning about foreign issues on these platforms,â Schiff said in a phone interview Sunday. Also Sunday, British lawmaker Damian Collins, who has been leading an investigation into political influence in which officials from Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have testified, suggested that neither company has been sufficiently forthcoming. âI will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he, or another senior executive from the company, appear to give evidence in front of the Committee as part our inquiry,â Collins said in his statement. âIt is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers. This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed.â VÄra JourovÃ¡, the justice commissioner for the European Union, described the reports as âhorrifying, if confirmed,â in a tweet.Â Ahead of a scheduled visit to the United States this coming week, she added that she would seek âfurther clarifications from #Facebook to understand this problem better.â Facebook declined to comment on theÂ calls for Zuckerberg to testify. The company said in a statement Sunday afternoon that it was renewing efforts toÂ investigate what happened with the data that reached Cambridge Analytica. âWe are in the process of conducting a comprehensive internal and external review as we work to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists. That is where our focus lies as we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect peopleâs information,â said Paul Grewal, Facebook's deputy general counsel, in the statement. Zuckerberg has kept a low profile as controversy over the political uses of the Facebook platform â especially by a Russian disinformation campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential race â has intensified. He hasÂ written blog posts and spoken by video link from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. But Zuckerberg has not yet been exposed to the rough-and-tumble of legislative questioning, designating that job to senior attorneys such as general counsel Colin Stretch. And on Sunday, the tech giant faced fresh criticism for its failure to be forthcoming with lawmakers investigating the matter. âSometimes, these companies grow so fast, and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves, that they start to think perhaps theyâre above the rules that apply to everybody else,â Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on NBCâs âMeet the Press.â The new controversy stems from the actions in 2014 and 2015 of aÂ Russian American professor, Aleksandr Kogan, working for Cambridge Analytica. His app, called thisisyourdigitallife, offered personality predictions and billed itself on Facebook as âa research app used by psychologists.â It gave Kogan access to demographic information about Facebook users â including the names of users, their âlikes,â friend lists and other data. Once obtained by Cambridge Analytica, political campaigns could use those profiles to target users with highly tailored messages, ads or fundraising requests. Facebook suspended Kogan, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and one other former Cambridge Analytica employee from the social media platform on Friday, hours ahead of news reports on the extent of the data grab.Â Cambridge Analytica has repeatedly denied wrongdoing or improper use of Facebook data. âWe worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebookâs terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted,â Cambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday. Facebook has acknowledged that its user data was collected on a vast scale, but it has declined to confirm or deny reports in the New York Times and the Observer of London that information from 50 million users was accessed. Facebook has said that changes it implemented in 2014 and 2015 sharply restricted the ability of app developers to collect data in this way. Facebook executives throughout the weekend resisted allegations that Cambridge Analytica's actions amounted to a âbreachâ of its systems because Facebook's systems were not compromised and the app developer worked within the company's terms of service, at least initially. In a tweet that has since been deleted, Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos argued on Saturday that developers working on the Android and Apple operating systems allowed access to Facebook âfriendâ data, and that the app developer did not break into any of the companyâs systems. Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica later violated terms by improperly sharing and then failing to destroy the data, despite assurances that it would do so. But the idea of a âbreachâ seems have taken root in the public debate and in some news reports. Klobuchar's statement refers to a âmajor breach.â Among the thorny issues facing Facebook is itsÂ 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. That agreement specified that Facebook must give consumers clear and prominent notice and obtain their express consent before their information is shared beyond the privacy settings they have established. Two former FTC officials who crafted the decree said Sunday that Facebook may have violated it, and could now be liable for many millions of dollars in civil fines. In a statement Saturday, Facebook said, âWe reject any suggestion of violation of the consent decree. We respected the privacy settings that people had in place. Privacy and data protections are fundamental to every decision we make.â Lawmakers on Capitol Hill said the news reports about Cambridge Analytica were troubling. âThe recent revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica raise serious questions about the extent to which the social media giant respected user privacy and whether it violated its consent decree with the FTC,â said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in a statement. âFacebook and Cambridge Analytical should be made to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee so that we can get to the bottom of these disturbing reports that may impact tens of millions of Americans.â U.S. lawmakers last fallÂ questioned Facebook and fellow tech giants Google and Twitter over the ways in which Russian agents used major social networking platforms to spreadÂ disinformationÂ during the 2016 election. The hearings emboldened many lawmakers, including Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), to call for new regulation of political advertisements that appear on those sites. Their bill has not yet advanced amid sharp partisan divisions over Russiaâs role in the election. In February, British legislators visited Washington to question Facebook, Google and Twitter about âfake newsâ and the extent of Russian disinformation online, particularly in the wake of Britain'sÂ vote to exit the European Union. Members of the House of Commons repeatedly criticized Facebook for failing to answer questions, at times threatening regulation. One member of Parliament, Jo Stevens, said Facebookâs relationship with its usersâ personal data âreminds me of an abusive relationship where there is coercive control going on.â At another point in the hearing, fellow lawmaker Rebecca PowÂ questioned whether Facebook was a âmassive surveillance operation.â In December, the Wall Street Journal reported that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III had requested documents from Cambridge Analytica, including copies of emails of any company employees who worked on the Trump campaign. On Saturday, a day after Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said she was opening a probe into Facebook in response to news reports about Cambridge Analytica.

In a wide-ranging, scathing speech delivered at a dinner event at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Soros applauded the European Union's heightened enforcement aimed at Web giants. He also called for greater regulation of the tech companies, seizing on a growing backlash against Silicon Valley. âFacebook and Google have grown into ever more powerful monopolies, they have become obstacles to innovation, and they have caused a variety of problems of which we are only now beginning to become aware,â he said, according to a transcript of the speech. Google and Facebook declined to comment. Soros made the remarks asÂ officials in Washington and industry critics continued to ramp up their scrutiny ofÂ the tech sector. That pressure has been directed at a broad array of issues,Â perhaps most prominently online advertising and the spread of disinformation on popular social media platforms. In response, Facebook and Google have said they are open to greater government oversight in their ad operations. But Facebook has gone even further in recent weeks, publiclyÂ grappling with its role in global society. Last week Facebook even admitted in a blog post that social media canÂ sometimes harm democracy. SorosÂ suggested that American officials draw from their European counterparts,Â particularly E.U. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager,Â whom he described asÂ the ânemesisâ of American tech monopolies. Vestager, a former Danish economy minister, and other E.U. officials have recently advanced a host of enforcement actions againstÂ prominent U.S. tech companies.Â E.U. officials have sued Google over alleged antitrust violations tied to its search engine, its mobile operating system and its ad platform. In 2016, competition authorities ordered Apple to pay Ireland more than $15 billion in uncollected taxes; and Facebook has been penalized by several privacy watchdogs for breaking data protection rules. Soros acknowledged that Europe's approach to antitrust law and regulation differs from that of the United States. But hisÂ criticism ofÂ Facebook and Google may empower Democrats who have already expressed skepticism toward Silicon Valley and the broader world of tech and telecom. In October, for instance, congressional Democrats, with notable support from Republican Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), introduced legislation that would place greater disclosure requirements on Web platforms that run political advertisements. The lawmakers behind the bill say the rules will help prevent Russia and other foreign powers from exploiting social media and undermining U.S. elections.Â And last summer,Â the Democratic PartyÂ released a broad economic agenda, dubbed a âBetter Deal,\" that included stricter enforcement of antitrust laws and a push against corporate monopolies. While Soros is often criticized by conservative figures who oppose his political projects, his attack on the tech giants highlights a brewing convergence between leaders on the left and the right who have come to view Silicon Valley as a perverse influence on the country. âIt is only a matter of time before the global dominance of the U.S. IT monopolies is broken,â Soros said. âDavos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered.â Hamza ShabanHamza Shaban is a technology reporter for The Washington Post.

Photograph: Jon Elswick/AP Alan Gould was hitting a wall. It was the late 1990s, and the political advertising operative had an idea about using a relatively newfangled tool â banner ads on web sites â to promote political candidates. âIt was pretty clear to me at the time that the ability to target and tailor messaging was perfect for political campaigns,â Gould recalled recently. âI did a whole presentation on the internet and the power to connect, track, do fundraising, target.â But when Gould finished his pitches, he would be met with blank stares. âI was a very lonely pied piper,â he says. Finally, in 1998, Gould found a political candidate who was so far behind in the polls, and so strapped for cash, that he was willing to take a risk and spend $100,000 on banner ads on the New York Times homepage. Peter Vallone, then a New York City council member challenging George Pataki for the governorship, gave Gould the green light for an ad buy that has since entered the history books as the first significant use of online advertising in a political campaign. The ads themselves are lost to internet history â Gould believes he may have copies somewhere on floppy discs. But itâs not hard to draw a line from that moment to Robert Muellerâs 16 February indictment of the Internet Research Agency, which alleges that Russian agents carried out a conspiracy to interfere with a US presidential election, in large part by purchasing targeted Facebook ads designed to âencourage US minority groups not to voteâ.Or to the news recently revealed in the Observer that 50m Facebook profiles were obtained and misused by data mining company Cambridge Analytica to target voters during the 2016 presidential election. Play Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer The Vallone ads contained rudimentary versions of many of the attributes that make digital advertising such a powerful â and terrifying â force today: the ability to target specific audiences with tailored messages, then track their reaction. âCome November 2000, I expect the question will no longer be whether web-based political advertising works,â wrote Cyrus Krohn, then the manager of political advertising for the Microsoft Network, in a prescient 1999 column for Slate, âbut whether it works too well.â Nearly 20 years later, the world has caught up to Krohnâs concerns, with some critics making the not entirely hyperbolic argument that micro-targeted âdark advertisingâ on Facebook is a fundamental threat to democracy itself. Is it too late for democracy to fix itself? Parscale had been a little-known digital marketing executive working out of Texas when he was tapped to build Trumpâs campaign website in 2015. Until then, digital advertising was barely a rounding error in campaign budgets. In 2008, the year Barack Obama became the first social media candidate, candidates spent just $22.25m on online political ads, according to an analysis by Borrell Associates. That number grew significantly in 2012, but the real explosion came in 2016, when campaigns pumped $1.4bn into digital ads. US presidential campaigns are often remembered â and understood â by their advertisements. Lyndon B Johnsonâs âDaisyâ ad powerfully (and controversially) set the stakes of an election in a nuclear world. George HW Bushâs âWillie Hortonâ attack ad still epitomizes the racist dog-whistle politics of the tough-on-crime era. The message, as much as the messenger, is a key part of the debate over who is best equipped to lead the country. But no such public debate took place around Trumpâs apparently game-changing digital political advertisements before election day. This is partly due to a loophole in the prevailing campaign finance law, which was written in 2002 and did not include internet ads in the class of regulated âelectioneering communicationsâ. But perhaps even more important is the very nature of online advertising, which is self-serve (just sign up with a credit card and go) and highly iterative. Parscale claims he typically ran 50,000 to 60,000 variations of Facebook ads each day during the Trump campaign, all targeting different segments of the electorate. Understanding the meaning of a single one of those ads would require knowing what the ad actually said, who the campaign targeted to see that ad, and how that audience responded. Multiply that by 100 and you have a headache; by 50,000 and youâll start to doubt your grasp on reality. Then remember that this is 50,000 a day over the course of a campaign that lasted more than a year. âThe reason I said it might work too well,â Krohn said in a recent interview with the Guardian, âis that mass marketing went away and micro-targeting â nano-targeting â came to fruition.â Any candidate using Facebook can put a campaign message promising one thing in front of one group of voters while simultaneously running an ad with a completely opposite message in front of a different group of voters. The ads themselves are not posted anywhere for the general public to see (this is whatâs known as âdark advertisingâ), and chances are, no one will ever be the wiser. Trump digital director says Facebook helped win the White House Read more That undermines the very idea of a âmarketplace of ideasâ, says Ann Ravel, a former member of the Federal Election Commission who has long advocated stricter regulations on digital campaigning. âThe way to have a robust democracy is for people to hear all these ideas and make decisions and discuss,â Ravel said. âWith microtargeting, that is not happening.â Parscale and his staff told reporters with Bloomberg that they used Facebook ads to target Hillary Clinton supporters with messages designed to make them sit the election out, including her own forays into dog-whistle politics from the 1990s, which the Trump campaign hoped would discourage black voters from turning out to the polls. That degree of political manipulation might be unsavory, but itâs also relatively old-fashioned. One digital campaign staffer (not affiliated with the Trump campaign) compared it to Richard Nixonâs Southern Strategy, only âtechnologically savvyâ. But new reporting by the Observer has revealed that the data analytics team that worked for Trump, Cambridge Analytica, went far beyond Nixonian dirty tricks. The firm obtained Facebook data harvested under the auspices of an academic study, the Observer has revealed, and then used that data to target millions of US voters based on their psychological weaknesses. âWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of peopleâs profiles,â whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Observer about the data theft, âand built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.â European elections Political advertising in the US is the wild west compared with other western democracies, which tend to have shorter election campaigns with strict regulations on the amount and type of spending permitted. Such rules may enhance the impact of digital advertising, which is much cheaper than television and largely unregulated. The UK has seen a rapid shift to digital campaigning following the Conservative partyâs embrace of Facebook in the 2015 general election. The Tories outspent Labour by a factor of 10 on Facebook advertisements, a decision that many political observers saw as decisive. In a country that bans political ads on television, Facebook enabled the Conservatives to reach 80.65% of users in targeted constituencies with its promoted posts and video ads, according to marketing materials created by Facebook. (At some point in the past year, the company began hiding previously produced âSuccess Storiesâ about its ability to sway election results.) The Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum went on to spend almost its entire budget on Facebook advertising, an investment that resulted in about 1bn targeted digital ads being served to voters over the course of a 10-week campaign. Though it is impossible to parse the exact impact of Facebook advertisements amid all the other factors that shape an electoral result (including organic Facebook content), the platform is increasingly cited as a factor in the growing electoral might of far-right groups in Europe. Supporters of the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party demonstrate outside the Chancellery in Berlin last week. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images The radical right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party reportedly worked with a US campaign consultancy and Facebook itself to target German voters susceptible to its anti-immigrant message during the 2017 election in which AfD surged in popularity to become the third-largest party in parliament. Campaigning in Italyâs recent election, which saw the rise of anti-establishment parties, including the populist Five Star Movement and the far-right League, largely took place on social media. Facebook advertisements and targeting information gathered by Italian transparency group Openpolis found that the neo-fascist Brothers of Italy party ran a Facebook ad targeting Italian adults who are interested in the paramilitary police force, the carabinieri. After the polls closed in Italy, the Leagueâs Matteo Salvini shared some words of gratitude with the press: âThank God for the internet. Thank God for social media. Thank God for Facebook.â Targeting the midterms While investigations into the 2016 US election and Brexit referendum continue, itâs worth remembering that more elections are fast approaching. Scores of countries will hold national elections in 2018, including Sweden, Ireland, Egypt, Mexico and Brazil. In the US, candidates for the 435 congressional and 35 Senate seats that are up for grabs in November are already running campaigns on Facebook, and we may never know what theyâre saying in those advertisements. Take, for example, Paul Nehlen, a candidate who is running a Republican primary challenge against the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, in Wisconsin. Nehlen is primarily known as a vehement antisemite who was once embraced by Steve Bannon and the Breitbart wing of the right, but was excommunicated after appearing on a white supremacist podcast. Theyâve built this incredibly powerful platform that allows very narrow targeting ... so that scares me Alan Mislove, professor According to his FEC filings, Nehlen spent at least $2,791.72 on Facebook ads in the final six months of 2017. What did that money buy? In the first instance, everything that any Facebook advertiser can get: access to one of the most powerful databases of personal information that has ever existed, with insights into individualsâ intimate relationships, political beliefs, consumer habits and internet browsing. Beyond that, we donât know. Nehlen could be using Facebook to target likely voters in his district with a message about infrastructure. Or he could have taken a list of his own core supporters (he has more than 40,000 likes on Facebook), used Facebookâs âlookalike audienceâ tool to find other people inclined to support his particular politics, then fed them ads designed to persuade more people to join him in hating Jews. Last fall, after Facebook had been forced to admit that, despite its initial denials, its platform had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the election, the company announced a set of reforms designed to assuage its critics â and stave off actual, enforceable regulation. Starting this summer, the platform has promised that every political ad will be linked back to the page that paid for it. The pages themselves will display every ad that theyâre running, as well as demographic information about the audience that they are reaching, a measure that Mark Zuckerberg claimed would âbring Facebook to an even higher standard of transparencyâ than the law requires for television or other media. A version of these reforms is already live in Canada, where users can see all the ads being run by a political candidate in a designated tab on their page. But there is good reason to be skeptical. Since 2014, Facebook has had a transparency tool for all ads served on the platform. Click on the upper right-hand corner of a Facebook ad and youâll see an option reading âWhy am I seeing this ad?â Click through and youâll get an explanation of the characteristics that make you desirable to the advertiser. So far so good, but a new study by computer scientists found that Facebookâs ad explanations were âoften incomplete and sometimes misleadingâ in a way that âmay allow malicious advertisers to easily obfuscate ad explanations that are discriminatory or that target privacy-sensitive attributesâ. Alan Mislove, a professor of computer science at Northeastern University and one of the studyâs co-authors, said that he gave Facebook credit for having the feature at all, noting that it is one of the only examples of a company offering any kind of explanation of how an algorithm actually works. But the findings do not paint a particularly pretty picture of Facebookâs ability to self-regulate. âTheyâve built this incredibly powerful platform that allows very narrow targeting, a very powerful tool that anyone on the internet can use, so that scares me,â Mislove said. âAnd up until very recently, there was very little accountability. You as a malicious actor on Facebook donât even really need to obfuscate your behavior, because the only person watching is Facebook.â Honest Ads Act The best hope for bringing some order to the realm of digital political ads is through updating US law for the Facebook era. A bipartisan proposal to do just that exists. In October, Senators Amy Klobuchar, Mark Warner and John McCain introduced the Honest Ads Act, which would close the loophole that allows internet ads to avoid regulation, and also require internet platforms (ie Facebook and Google) to maintain a public file of all the political ads they run and who paid for them. But as much as we need transparency around political ads to maintain democracy, we also need a functioning democracy to get that transparency. And itâs not clear that itâs not already too late. âIn an ideal world, with a fully functioning Congress, there would be hearings around the Honest Ads Act, and you would have Facebook and Google and Twitter and experts testify to shine a light on the nature of political advertising,â said Brendan Fischer, director of FEC reform at the Campaign Legal Center. âWeâre not close to that at all.â In the absence of a fully functioning Congress, what is to be done? Should we expect Facebook to simply stop selling political ads? Antonio Garcia Martinez, a former product manager for Facebook who helped develop its advertising toolssays that he has come to realize that political ads are simply a different beast than commercial ones, which can and should be treated differently by his former employer. âSelling shoes needs to be different than selling politicians, even though the mechanics of it are identical,â he said. âMorally itâs different.â Or should we pressure Facebook to stop allowing candidates with hateful or extremist views to use its tools? âIf we farm these important democratic responsibilities out to a private company, today they might be regulating antisemitism, but tomorrow theyâre regulating what people can say about the Honest Ads Act,â Fischer said. Indeed, Facebook could already be suppressing political views unfavorable to its business practices, and we would have no way of knowing. Itâs possible Facebook wouldnât even know. In response to queries about inconsistent moderation of clothing advertisements, a Facebook spokeswoman recently told the New York Times that âthe company could not ask an automated system about [its] decisionsâ. Frankensteinâs monster is not under any humanâs control. No one can pretend Facebook is just harmless fun any more | Ellie Mae OâHagan Read more If this all seems positively dystopian, one person who is surprisingly sanguine is Alan Gould. Gould left politics soon after the Vallone campaign, founded an advertising analytics firm, sold it, and is now a tech investor. He does have concerns about media literacy and Facebookâs tendency to trap people in filter bubbles, but says: âIf people choose to stay in that bubble and not explore anything outside of it, thatâs a statement about who they are and not about the technology. âIf youâre going to have a representative democracy, then you have to have a way to communicate with the voters and youâre going to use whatever is available, whether thatâs newspapers or mail or email or Snapchat,â he said. âI donât regret it at all.â"}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2 Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still donât know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we wonât until Facebook comes clean and notifies users.

Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics â including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5 For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the companyâs poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebookâs settlement.6 Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are â or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data. We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone â including the Trump campaign â who might potentially use this data from Facebookâs platform."}

Before he was sentenced, Buchta read a brief statement to the court apologizing to his victims and laying out the steps heâs taken to be a âbetter man,â including earning a high school degree, holding a job and addressing long-standing issues of anxiety and depression. âI feel like Iâm a productive member of society,â said Buchta, reading from prepared remarks. âI have a lot to offer the world.â Minutes later, when Shah announced that his sentence would include prison time, Buchta burst into tears as his lawyer, Jay Leiderman, rubbed his back and consoled him. Buchta, who has been allowed to live with his mother, Patricia, in Fallston, Md., while the case was pending, was ordered to surrender by May 22. As part of his plea deal, he also must pay $350,000 in restitution to two online gambling companies that were victimized by his schemes. Buchta was just 17 when he came under FBI scrutiny as a founding member of the prolific hacker groups Lizard Squad and PoodleCorp, which charged a $20 fee to target anyone for online harassment. Agents confronted Buchta at his home in 2014, but no charges were filed at the time. In fact, Buchta taunted authorities after he was questioned, even adopting the Twitter handle @fbiarelosers, according to court records. In October 2016, Buchta was arrested and charged in a criminal complaint with launching a wide range of attacks over a two-year period, including shutting down the web networks of gaming companies and initiating so-called phone-bombing schemes that inundated victims with harassing phone calls. One of his first victims, who lived in the Chicago area, started receiving expletive-laden phone calls every hour, according to a criminal complaint. The calls went on for 30 straight days. \"Your target will be left with only 3 options,\" the hackers allegedly boasted on their webpage, phoneBomber.net. \"Change their number, Bend to your whim, deal with a ringing phone for the length of our attack :\\\" The loosely based crew also sold stolen payment card account information on thousands of victims, prosecutors said. The charges stemmed from an international investigation and were among the first brought in the U.S. against alleged members of Lizard Squad. Although the hacker group has been known in the security industry for some time, it rose to prominence during the 2014 Christmas season when it launched a crippling attack on Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox Live gaming networks, according to news reports. In January 2015, Lizard Squad made headlines by hijacking social media accounts of Grammy-winning pop singer Taylor Swift. The group sent tweets from Swift's account instructing her millions of fans to follow two Lizard Squad-related Twitter accounts, then threatened to release nude photos of the superstar in exchange for bitcoins. Swift shut down the extortion attempt, however, by announcing to fans that there were no nude photos. \"My twitter got hacked but don't worry,\" she wrote to fans on Tumblr, according to one news account. \"Twitter is deleting the hacker tweets and locking my account until they can figure out how this happened and get me new passwords. Never a dull moment.\" The 61-page complaint alleged Buchta and a co-defendant who lived in the Netherlands operated websites that enabled paying customers to select victims to receive repeated harassing phone calls from spoofed numbers. In October 2015, they boasted online that the person in Illinois had become their \"first victim,\" according to the complaint. That day, the victim, identified in the complaint only as Victim O, started receiving hourly phone calls with the same recorded message. \"When you walk the (expletive) streets, (expletive), you better look over your (expletive) back because I don't flying (expletive) if we have to burn your (expletive) house down,\" the message said, according to the complaint. \"If we have to (expletive) track your (expletive) family down, we will (expletive) your (expletive) up (expletive).\""}

In January, reports surfaced that Portal might launch this year, but yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Facebook won't be unveiling its home products at its F8 developer conference in May as was initially planned. The pullback is attributed to the ongoing Cambridge Analytica controversy and growing concerns over how Facebook handles its users' data. Now, The Information reports that the company is also considering alternative privacy safeguards among its smart home devices. According to The Information, Facebook now plans to limit the processing and storing of video data to the device itself instead of on its servers. A source close to the company said that the move comes after months of discussions with privacy experts. Facebook already has a massive trove of facial data on its many, many users and this latest scandal hasn't done much towards fostering trust in how the company manages that data. Some are expressing concern over the extra power Facebook might gain from having a video device in people's homes. \"It would be concerning in my mind if Facebook is designing and releasing a hardware device that uses facial recognition, as they already have one of the largest facial recognition databases in the world,\" Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Jennifer Lynch told The Information. \"It would allow them to really take their algorithms to a whole new level because it would be scanning people inside the home from all different perspectives.\""}

Back then, it was still mostly folks wearing computers in satchels and cameras on their heads. âThey were basically cell phones, except we had to solder it together ourselves,â Pentland says. But the hardware wasn't the important part. The ways the devices interacted was. âYou scale that up and you realize, holy crap, weâll be able to see everybody on Earth all the time,â he saysâwhere they went, who they knew, what they bought. And so by the middle of the decade, when massive social networks like Facebook were taking off, Pentland and his fellow social scientists were beginning to look at network and cell phone data to see how epidemics spread, how friends relate to each other, and how political alliances form. âWeâd accidentally invented a particle accelerator for understanding human behavior,â says David Lazer, a data-oriented political scientist then at Harvard. âIt became apparent to me that everything was changing in terms of understanding human behavior.â In late 2007 Lazer put together a conference entitled âComputational Social Science,â along with Pentland and other leaders in analyzing what people today call big data. In early 2009 the attendees of that conference published a statement of principles in the prestigious journal Science. In light of the role of social scientists in the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica debacleâslurping up data on online behavior from millions of users, figuring out the personalities and predilections of those users, and nominally using that knowledge to influence electionsâthat article turns out to be prescient. âThese vast, emerging data sets on how people interact surely offer qualitatively new perspectives on collective human behavior,â the researchers wrote. But, they added, this emerging understanding came with risks. \"Perhaps the thorniest challenges exist on the data side, with respect to access and privacy,â the paper said. âBecause a single dramatic incident involving a breach of privacy could produce rules and statutes that stifle the nascent field of computational social science, a self-regulatory regime of procedures, technologies, and rules is needed that reduces this risk but preserves research potential.â Possibly even more disturbing than the idea that Cambridge Analytica tried to steal an electionâsomething lots of people say probably isnât possibleâis the role of scientists in facilitating the ethical breakdowns behind it. When Zeynep Tufekci argues that what Facebook does with peopleâs personal data is so pervasive and arcane that people canât possibly give informed consent to it, sheâs employing the language of science and medicine. Scientists are supposed to have acquired, through painful experience, the knowledge of how to treat human subjects in their research. Because it can go terribly wrong. Hereâs whatâs worse: The scientists warned us about big data and corporate surveillance. They tried to warn themselves. In big data and computation, the social sciences saw a chance to grow up. âMost of the things we think we know about humanity are based on pitifully little data, and as a consequence theyâre not strong science,â says Pentland, an author of the 2009 paper. âItâs all stories and heuristics.â But data and computational social science promised to change that. Itâs what science always hopes forânot merely to quantify the now but to calculate whatâs to come. Scientists can do it for stars and DNA and electrons; people have been more elusive. Then theyâd take the next quantum leap. Observation and prediction, if you get really good at them, lead to the ability to act upon the system and bring it to heel. Itâs the same progress that leads from understanding heritability to sequencing DNA to genome editing, or from Newton to Einstein to GPS. That was the promise of Cambridge Analytica: to use computational social science to influence behavior. Cambridge Analytica said it could do it. It apparently cheated to get the data. And the catastrophe that the authors of that 2009 paper warned of has come to pass. Pentland puts it more pithily: âWe called it.â The 2009 paper recommends that researchers be better trainedâin both big-data methods and in the ethics of handling such data. It suggests that the infrastructure of science, like granting agencies and institutional review boards, should get stronger at handling new demands, because data spills and difficulties in anonymizing bulk data were already starting to slow progress. Historically, when some group recommends self-regulation and new standards, itâs because that group is worried someone else is about to do it for themâusually a government. In this case, though, the scientists were worried, they wrote, about Google, Yahoo, and the National Security Agency. âComputational social science could become the exclusive domain of private companies and government agencies. Alternatively, there might emerge a privileged set of academic researchers presiding over private data from which they produce papers that cannot be critiqued or replicated,â they wrote. Only strong rules for collaborations between industry and academia would allow access to the numbers the scientists wanted but also protect consumers and users. âEven when we were working on that paper we recognized that with great power comes great responsibility, and any technology is a dual-use technology,â says Nicholas Christakis, head of the Human Nature Lab at Yale, one of the participants in the conference, and a co-author of the paper. âNuclear power is a dual-use technology. It can be weaponized.â Welp. âIt is sort of what we anticipated, that there would be a Three Mile Island moment around data sharing that would rock the research community,â Lazer says. âThe reality is, academia did not build an infrastructure. Our call for getting our house in order? Iâd say it has been inadequately addressed.â Cambridge Analyticaâs scientific foundationâas reporting from The Guardian has shownâseems to mostly derive from the work of Michal Kosinski, a psychologist now at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and David Stillwell, deputy director of the Psychometrics Centre at Cambridge Judge Business School (though neither worked for Cambridge Analytica or affiliated companies). In 2013, when they were both working at Cambridge, Kosinski and Stillwell were co-authors on a big study that attempted to connect the language people used in their Facebook status updates with the so-called Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism). Theyâd gotten permission from Facebook users to ingest status updates via a personality quiz app. Along with another researcher, Kosinski and Stillwell also used a related dataset to, they said, determine personal traits like sexual orientation, religion, politics, and other personal stuff using nothing but Facebook Likes. Supposedly it was this ideaâthat you could derive highly detailed personality information from social media interactions and personality testsâthat led another social science researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, to develop a similar approach via an app, get access to even more Facebook user data, and then hand it all to Cambridge Analytica. (Kogan denies any wrongdoing and has said in interviews that he is just a scapegoat.) But take a beat here for a second. That initial Kosinski paper is worth a look. It asserts that Likes enable a machine learning algorithm to predict attributes like intelligence. The best predictors of intelligence, according to the paper? They include thunderstorms, the Colbert Report, science, and â¦ curly fries. Low intelligence: Sephora, âI love being a mom,â Harley Davidson, and Lady Antebellum. The paper looked at sexuality, too, finding that male homosexuality was well-predicted by liking the No H8 campaign, Mac cosmetics, and the musical Wicked. Strong predictors of male heterosexuality? Wu-Tang Clan, Shaq, and âbeing confused after waking up from naps.â Ahem. If that feels like you might have been able to guess any of those things without a fancy algorithm, well, the authors acknowledge the possibility. âAlthough some of the Likes clearly relate to their predicted attribute, as in the case of No H8 Campaign and homosexuality,â the paper concludes, âother pairs are more elusive; there is no obvious connection between Curly Fries and high intelligence.â Kosinski and his colleagues went on, in 2017, to make more explicit the leap from prediction to control. In a paper titled âPsychological Targeting as an Effective Approach to Digital Mass Persuasion,â they exposed people with specific personality traitsâextraverted or introverted, high openness or low opennessâto advertisements for cosmetics and a crossword puzzle game tailored to those traits. (An aside for my nerds: Likes for âStargateâ and âcomputersâ predicted introversion, but Kosinski and colleagues acknowledged that a potential weakness is that Likes could change in significance over time. âLiking the fantasy show Game of Thrones might have been highly predictive of introversion in 2011,â they wrote, âbut its growing popularity might have made it less predictive over time as its audience became more mainstream.â) Now, clicking on an ad doesnât necessarily show that you can change someoneâs political choices. But Kosinski says political ads would be even more potent. âIn the context of academic research, we cannot use any political messages, because it would not be ethical,â says Kosinski. âThe assumption is that the same effects can be observed in political messages.â But itâs true that his team saw more responses to tailored ads than mistargeted ads. (To be clear, this is what Cambridge Analytica said it could do, but Kosinski wasnât working with the company.) Reasonable people could disagree. As for the 2013 paper, âall it shows is that algorithmic predictions of Big 5 traits are about as accurate as human predictions, which is to say only about 50 percent accurate,â says Duncan Watts, a sociologist at Microsoft Research and one of the inventors of computational social science. âIf all you had to do to change someoneâs opinion was guess their openness or political attitude, then even really noisy predictions might be worrying at scale. But predicting attributes is much easier than persuading people.â Watts says that the 2017 paper didnât convince him the technique could work, either. The results barely improve click-through rates, he saysâa far cry from predicting political behavior. And more than that, Kosinskiâs mistargeted openness adsâthat is, the ads tailored for the opposite personality characteristicâfar outperformed the targeted extraversion ads. Watts says that suggests other, uncontrolled factors are having unknown effects. âSo again,â he says, âI would question how meaningful these effects are in practice.\" To the extent a company like Cambridge Analytica says it can use similar techniques for political advantage, Watts says that seems \"shady,\" and heâs not the only one who thinks so. âOn the psychographic stuff, I havenât see any science that really aligns with their claims,â Lazer says. âThereâs just enough there to make it plausible and point to a citation here or there.â Kosinski disagrees. âTheyâre going against an entire industry,â he says. âThere are billions of dollars spent every year on marketing. Of course a lot of it is wasted, but those people are not morons. They donât spend money on Facebook ads and Google ads just to throw it away.â Even if trait-based persuasion doesnât work as Kosinski and his colleagues hypothesize and Cambridge Analytica claimed, the troubling part is that another trained researcherâKoganâallegedly delivered data and similar research ideas to the company. In a press release posted on the Cambridge Analytica website on Friday, the acting CEO and former chief data officer of the company denied wrongdoing and insisted that the company deleted all the data they were supposed to according to Facebookâs changing rules. And as for the data that Kogan allegedly brought in via his company GSR, he wrote, Cambridge Analytica âdid not use any GSR data in the work we did in the 2016 US presidential election.â Either way, the overall idea of using human behavioral science to sell ads and products without oversight is still the core of Facebook's business model. âClearly these methods are being used currently. But those arenât examples of the methods being used to understand human behavior,â Lazer says. âTheyâre not trying to create insights but to use methods out of the academy to optimize corporate objectives.â Lazer is being circumspect; let me put that a different way: They are trying to use science to manipulate you into buying things. So maybe Cambridge Analytica wasnât the Three Mile Island of computational social science. But that doesnât mean it isnât a signal, a ping on the Geiger counter. It shows people are trying. Facebook knows that the social scientists have tools the company can use. Late in 2017, a Facebook blog post admitted that maybe people were getting a little messed up by all the time they spend on social media. âWe also worry about spending too much time on our phones when we should be paying attention to our families,â wrote David Ginsberg, Facebookâs director of research, and Moira Burke, a Facebook research scientist. âOne of the ways we combat our inner struggles is with research.â And with that they laid out a short summary of existing work, and name-checked a bunch of social scientists with whom the company is collaborating. This, it strikes me, is a little bit like a member of congress caught in a bribery sting insisting he was conducting his own investigation. Itâs also, of course, exactly what the social scientists warned of a decade ago. But those social scientists, it turns out, worry a lot less about Facebook Likes than they do about phone calls and overnight deliverys. âEverybody talks about Google and Facebook, but the things that people say online are not nearly as predictive as, say, what your telephone company knows about you. Or your credit card company,â Pentland says. âFortunately telephone companies, banks, things like that are very highly regulated companies. So we have a fair amount of time. It may never happen that the data gets loose.â Here, Kosinski agrees. âIf you use data more intrusive than Facebook Likes, like credit card records, if you use methods better than just posting an ad on someoneâs Facebook wall, if you spend more money and resources, if you do a lot of A-B testing,â he says, âof course you would boost the efficiency.â Using Facebook Likes is the kind of thing an academic does, Kosinski says. If you really want to nudge a network of humans, he recommends buying credit card records. Kosinski also suggests hiring someone slicker than Cambridge Analytica. âIf people say Cambridge Analytica won the election for Trump, it probably helped, but if he had hired a better company, the efficiency would be even higher,â he says. That's why social scientists are still worried. They worry about someone taking that quantum leap to persuasion and succeeding. âI spent quite some time and quite some effort reporting what Dr. Kogan was doing, to the head of the department and legal teams at the university, and later to press like the Guardian, so Iâm probably more offended than average by the methods,â Kosinski says. âBut the bottom line is, essentially they could have achieved the same goal without breaking any rules. It probably would have taken more time and cost more money.â Pentland says the next frontier is microtargetting, when political campaigns and extremist groups sock-puppet social media accounts to make it seem like an entire community is spontaneously espousing similar beliefs. âThat sort of persuasion, from people you think are like you having what appears to be a free opinion, is enormously effective,â Pentland says. âAdvertising, you can ignore. Having people you think are like you have the same opinion is how fads, bubbles, and panics start.â For now itâs only working on edge cases, if at all. But next time? Or the time after that? Well, they did try to warn us."}

But every Facebook appâeven the dumb, innocent onesâcollected usersâ personal data without even trying. For a spell during 2010 and 2011, I was a virtual rancher of clickable cattle on Facebook. It feels like a long time ago. Obama was serving his first term as president. Google+ hadnât arrived, let alone vanished again. Steve Jobs was still alive, as was Kim Jong Il. Facebookâs IPO hadnât yet taken place, and its service was still fun to useâalthough it was littered with requests and demands from social games, like FarmVille and Pet Society. Iâd had enough of itâthe click-farming games, for one, but also Facebook itself. Already in 2010, it felt like a malicious attention market where people treated friends as latent resources to be optimized. Compulsion rather than choice devoured peopleâs time. Apps like FarmVille sold relief for the artificial inconveniences they themselves had imposed. In response, I made a satirical social game called Cow Clicker. Players clicked a cute cow, which mooed and scored a âclick.â Six hours later, they could do so again. They could also invite friendsâ cows to their pasture, buy virtual cows with real money, compete for status, click to send a real cow to the developing world from Oxfam, outsource clicks to their toddlers with a mobile app, and much more. It became strangely popular, until eventually, I shut the whole thing down in a bovine raptureâthe âcowpocalypse.â Itâs kind of a complicated story. But one worth revisiting today, in the context of the scandal over Facebookâs sanctioning of user-data exfiltration via its application platform. Itâs not just that abusing the Facebook platform for deliberately nefarious ends was easy to do (it was). But worse, in those days, it was hard to avoid extracting private data, for years even, without even trying. I did it with a silly cow game. * * * Cow Clicker is not an impressive work of software. After all, it was a game whose sole activity was clicking on cows. I wrote the principal code in three days, much of it hunched on a friendâs couch in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. I had no idea anyone would play it, although over 180,000 people did, eventually. I made a little money from the whole affair, but I never optimized it for revenue generation. I certainly never pondered using the app as a lure for a data-extraction con. I was just a strange man making a strange game on a lark. And yet, if you played Cow Clicker, even just once, I got enough of your personal data that, for years, I could have assembled a reasonably sophisticated profile of your interests and behavior. I might still be able to; all the data is still there, stored on my private server, where Cow Clicker is still running, allowing players to keep clicking where a cow once stood, before my caprice raptured them into the digital void. The authorization dialog for the game Candy Crush. (King / Facebook) To understand why withdrawing data was the default behavior in Facebook apps, you have to know something about how apps get made and published on Facebook. In 2007, the company turned its social-network service into an application platform. The idea was that Facebook could grow its number of users and the time they spent engaged by allowing people and organizations to build services overtop of it. And those people and organizations would benefit by plugging into a large network of users, whose network of friends could easily be made a part of the service, both for social interaction and viral spread. When you access an app on Facebookâs website, be it a personality-quiz, a game, a horoscope, or a sports community, the service presents you with an authorization dialog, where the specific data an app says it needs is displayed for the userâs consideration. That could be anything from your name, friend list, and email address, to your photos, likes, direct messages and more. The information shared with an app by default has changed over time, and even a savvy user might never have known what comprised it. When I launched Cow Clicker in 2010, it was easier to acquire both âbasicâ information (name, gender, networks, and profile picture) and âextendedâ user information (location, relationship status, likes, posts, and more). In 2014, Facebook began an app review process for information beyond that which a user shared publicly, but for years before that, the decision was left to the user alone. This is consistent with Facebookâs longstanding, official policy on privacy, which revolves around user control rather than procedural verification. App authorizations are not exceptionally clear. For one thing, the user must accept the appâs request to share data with it as soon as they open it for the first time, even before knowing what the app does or why. For another, the authorization is presented by Facebook, not by the third party, making it seem official, safe, and even endorsed. Cow Clicker on Facebook, 2010. The game appears to live natively inside the Facebook interface, but it runsâand stores its dataâon a separate server. (Cow Clicker / Ian Bogost / The Atlantic) The part of the Facebook website where apps appear, under the blue top navigation (as seen above), introduces further confusion. To the average web user, especially a decade ago, it looked like the game or app was just a part of Facebook itself. The page is seamless, with no boundary between the siteâs navigational chrome and the third-party app. If you look at the browser address bar while using a Facebook app on the website, the URL begins with âapps.facebook.com,â further cementing the impression that the user was safely ensconced in the comforting, blue cradle of Facebookâs care. Thatâs not what really takes place. When a user loads an app, Facebookâs servers pass those requests to a remote computer, where the individual or company that made the app hosts their services. The app sends its responses to Facebook, which formats and presents them to the user, as if they were inside of Facebook itself. The authorization process happens once, the first time the app is accessed for a specific user. After that, every time the user loads the app, Facebook sends it a payload of basic user data to facilitate the appâs operation (additional data can be requested separately when needed). For years, these transmissions were even conducted unencrypted, until Facebook required apps to communicate with its service over a secure connection. Beyond its own terms of service for applications, which many developers probably didnât read or feel compelled to heed, Facebook âsecuredâ user data shared with third-parties by requiring every app to publish a privacy policy. Because data sharing was seen as a form of user-control, not corporate policy, Facebook doesnât appear to review platform-developer privacy policies. As far as I can tell, all the platform did was to insure that accessing the URL for an appâs privacy policy didnât result in a page-not-found error. Facebook was checking that privacy policies existed as reachable web pages, not that they existed as privacy policies, let alone policies that provided any specific protections. And besides, users probably never read the policies, which were linked unassumingly from the application-permissions interface. They might easily, and reasonably, have assumed that Facebook was simply reiterating its own privacy policy when presenting new access to an app. They would have been wrong. In essence, Facebook was presenting apps as quasi-endorsed extensions of its core service to users who couldnât have been expected to know better. That might explain why so many people feel violated by Facebook this weekâthey might never have realized that they were even using foreign, non-Facebook applications in the first place, let alone ones that were siphoning off and selling their data. The website always just looked like Facebook. In the case of Cow Clicker, which only ever aimed to let people click on pictures of cows, I was able to access two potentially sensitive pieces of data without even trying. The first is a playerâs Facebook ID. This is a numeric, unique identifier attached to every Facebook account. Once I have your Facebook ID, I can look up your profile programmatically, or I can just load it in the public website by appending it to âfacebook.comââMark Zuckerbergâs is 4. These days, Facebook generates a unique, app-specific ID for each user, in order to prevent an app from connecting someone directly to Facebook profiles. But back in Cow Clickerâs heyday of 2010, Facebook didnât do this, and every app got your actual ID. Those data could be correlated against other informationâdata collected from Facebook, fashioned by the app, or acquired elsewhere. Because I collected and stored my usersâ true Facebook IDs to be able to count their clicks and build their pastures and the like, I still have them, and, in theory, I could use them nefariously. A 2014 terms-of-service update prohibits some of that activity, but not everyone cares about violating the Facebook terms of service. The second type of information is a piece of profile data Cow Clicker received without asking for it. Back in 2010, Facebook still allowed users to join ânetworksââaffiliations like schools, workplaces, and organizations. In some cases, those affiliations required authorization, for example having an email address at a domain that corresponds with a university. Over time, verification became less important to Facebook, and now users can affiliate with schools or workplaces arbitrarily. The less friction, the more data. In 2010, on my friendâs couch in Brooklyn, I noticed that Facebook was shipping user affiliation data over the wire to me, so I decided to store it. Facebook allowed apps to store data for which user permission was granted, but urged developers not to request or store more than it needed to operate. Putting affiliation data in the Cow Clicker database allowed me to provide leaderboard rankings by network, allowing my players to compete for clicks with their work colleagues or classmates. Thatâs neither a terribly interesting feature nor a particularly wicked one. But because I stored the numerical identifiers for user affiliations, I still have them. Until 2016, I could use a database-query tool called FQL, Facebook Query Language, to retrieve the details of those networks, and correlate them back to my users. Had I wanted to, I could have recombined that information with other data and used it for retargeting. Cow Clickerâs example is so modest, it might not even seem like a problem. What does it matter if a simple diversion has your Facebook ID, education, and work affiliations? Especially since its solo creator (thatâs me) was too dumb or too lazy to exploit that data toward pernicious ends. But even if I hadnât thought about it at the time, I could have done so years later, long after the cows vanished, and once Cow Clicker players forgot that theyâd ever installed my app. This is also why Zuckerbergâs response to the present controversy feels so toothless. Facebook has vowed to audit companies that have collected, shared, or sold large volumes of data in violation of its policy, but the company cannot close the Pandoraâs box it opened a decade ago, when it first allowed external apps to collect Facebook user data. That information is now in the hands of thousands, maybe millions of people. To be honest, Iâm not even sure I know what the Facebook platformâs terms of service dictated that I do with user data acquired from Facebook. Technically, users could revoke certain app permissions later, and apps were supposed to remove any impacted data that they had stored. I doubt most apps did that, and I suspect users never knewâand still donât knowâthat revoking access to an app they used eight years ago doesnât do anything to reverse transmissions that took place years ago. As Jason Koebler put it at Motherboard, itâs too late. âIf your data has already been taken, Facebook has no mechanism and no power to make people delete it. If your data was taken, it has very likely been sold, laundered, and put back into Facebook.â Indeed, all the publicity around Facebookâs Cambridge Analytica crisis might be sending lots of old app developers, like me, back to old code and dusty databases, wondering what theyâve even got stored and what it might yet be worth. Facebookâs laissez-faire openness surely contributed to the data-extraction free-for-all thatâs playing itself out now via the example of Cambridge Analytica. But so did its move-fast-and-break-things attitude toward software development. The Facebook platform was truly a nightmare to use and to maintain. It was built like no other software system then extant, and it changed constantlyâregular updates rolled out weekly. Old code broke, seemingly for no good reason. Some Facebook app developers were dishonest from the start, and others couldnât help themselves once they saw the enormous volume of data they could slurp from millions or tens of millions of Facebook users. But many more were just struggling to eke out a part of their living in an ecosystem where people might discover them. Millions of apps had been created by 2012, when I hung up my cowboy hat. Not only apps apparently designed with duplicity in mind, like Aleksandr Koganâs personality-quiz, which extracted data that was then sold to Cambridge Analytica. But hundreds of thousands of creators of dumb toys, quizzes, games, and communities that might never have intended to dupe or violate users surely did so anyway, because Facebook rammed their data down our throats. On the whole, none of us asked for your data. But we have it anyway, and forever. We want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com.

The move came as a host of U.S. and European lawmakers to demanded an explanation of how the consulting firm, which worked on President Donald Trump's election campaign, gained access to the data. In the U.S., members of Congress called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify about Facebook's actions. (reut.rs/2pn8btD) Facebook said on Monday it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analytical still had the data. “Auditors from Strop Fried berg were on site at Cambridge Analytic’s London office this evening,” the company said in a statement late Monday. “At the request of the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, which has announced it is pursuing a warrant to conduct its own on-site investigation, the Strop Fried berg auditors stood down.” Facebook shares closed down nearly 7.0 percent on Monday, wiping nearly $40 billion off its market value as investors worried that new legislation could damage the company’s advertising business. “The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook data practices, and the picture is not pretty,” said Frank Passable, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley’s use of data. Also on Monday, a source said that Facebook head of security, Alex Stamps, plans to leave the company over disagreements about the company’s policies on misinformation. He had been a strong advocate for an aggressive approach to alleged Russian activity on the platform aimed at manipulating elections. His departure was first reported by the New York Times. Facebook declined immediate comment. In a tweet, Stamps did not deny he was leaving but said: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change.” The criticism of Cambridge Analytical presents a new threat to Facebook reputation, which is already under attack over Russia’s alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election. London-based Cambridge Analytical said it strongly denied the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules. However, further allegations about the firm’s tactics were reported late Monday by British broadcaster Channel 4 which said it secretly taped interviews with senior Cambridge Analytical executives in which they boasted of their ability to sway elections in countries around the world with digital manipulation and traditional political trickery. Cambridge Analytical rejected the allegations, saying in a statement that the Channel 4 report “is edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.” Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from the U.S. Congress after the reports in the New York Times and London’s Observer over the weekend. Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Widen sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties. Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers. Facebook and other social media companies including Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled. Late on Monday, the Connecticut Attorney General said the office will initiate an inquiry into Facebook data policies.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration The Senate was expected to move forward on Monday with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry’s legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking. The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law. Facebook said on Friday it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytical from a psychology testing application he had built. Facebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved and said the data had been misused but not stolen, because users gave permission. Related Coverage ‘VERY CONCERNING’ European officials, who have been more willing to regulate Silicon Valley companies than their U.S. counterparts, were strident in criticism of Facebook. The revelations about Cambridge Analytical were “horrifying, if confirmed,” said EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova. “We don’t want this in the EU and will take all possible legal measures” including stricter rules under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation that takes effect in May, she said. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said the allegations were “clearly very concerning.” The head of the European Parliament said EU lawmakers will investigate possible data misuse, calling the allegations an unacceptable violation of citizens’ privacy rights."}

Facebook knew about the leak as far back as 2015 and neither said nor did anything.2 Facebook is now scrambling to do damage control and potentially facing a massive fine from the Federal Trade Commission.3But we still donât know whose data the Trump campaign accessed, and we wonât until Facebook comes clean and notifies users. Tell Facebook: Come clean about data breach. Cambridge Analyticaâs CEO called the data the âsecret sauceâ that helped Donald Trump secure the White House.4 Cambridge Analytica is a secretive right-wing campaign firm backed by the far-right billionaire Stephen Mercer that worked closely with a former Mercer favorite, white supremacist Steve Bannon, on the Trump campaign. Company executives have been caught on tape bragging about its unethical tactics â including hiring prostitutes to blackmail politicians.5 For years, Facebook allowed third-party app developers using its platform to access the private data both of users of their apps and all of their friends. One app with less than 270,000 users accessed 50 million profiles and created a dataset that a researcher provided to Cambridge Analytica. The Federal Trade Commission punished Facebook in 2011 over the companyâs poor privacy standards and is investigating whether this new revelation violates Facebookâs settlement.6 Still, no one knows who these 50 million people are â or even if the Trump campaign or other entities are still exploiting their data. We cannot let Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg lawyer up and try to spin their way out of this one. We need to pressure Facebook to come clean about the breach, notify everyone affected and block anyone â including the Trump campaign â who might potentially use this data from Facebookâs platform."}
